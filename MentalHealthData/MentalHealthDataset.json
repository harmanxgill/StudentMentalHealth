New Years. I wish you all a happy new years. Learn from your successes and failures in this last year, and use the latter to motivate you in the coming year.

Happy new year.","2":"This is how lonely i am.. Happy new year.","3":"How to deal with one sided friendships?. i am the type of person who puts others first (more than i probably should). i always make myself available when my friends need me, i never break commitments, remember birthdays and special events, etc. yet, i always feel very hurt and upset when people don\u2019t reciprocate this gesture or treat me with the same level of respect. \n\nfor instance, i have this one friend whom i met in uni. we are in different programs so we never see each other that often; nevertheless, i try my best to maintain that friendship. the problem is, whenever I text this friend, i usually feel anxious because i am never sure when this individual will respond back. like i greeted this friend this holiday season but i didn\u2019t even get a response back which feels like a slap in the face since the holiday season is now over. the thing is, i know this friend has been online (liking our mutual friends\u2019 posts on instagram and facebook). i know the instance this individual texts back, i will respond asap. it is this endless cycle where my feelings are never heard which bothers me. \n\nmy one concern is that I\u2019m compromising my own wellbeing for the sake of keeping this friendship alive. every time i feel hurt by someone abusing my good nature, i always tell myself not to confront them, just wait it out and act like it\u2019s no big deal and get the friendship back.\n\ndoes anyone else do this? has confrontation ever worked? any advice would be appreciated!","4":"Escape reality. Sometimes I just wanna say f this and fly to some obscure jungle and live my own life. \n\nBut I'm gonna die in Day 2 while trying to roast a fruit so Im stuck here for now.","5":"Slow Decline. **&gt; Long post about my personal mental health ahead, just looking for some advice.**\n\n  \nI'm not really happy with my exam marks. I've done so much better in the past, and don't really know what's going on. I remember first semester, first year I was doing really well, genuinely enjoying my courses, and going to class.   \n\n\nNow my problem is I'm sleeping more than 10h every night, and during the semester I couldn't wake myself up to go to class, I have no motivation to do my assignments, and its just a general struggle.  \nThis year, I started taking medication for ADHD again after a long while of not having it, but it has yet to help much. I recently switched medications over this winter break, so we'll see how that goes, but I doubt it will be life-changing, as clearly my problem is something deeper.  \n\n\nI'm currently staying on-campus. I'm not sure whether or not this living situation has benefits or drawbacks towards my working life. Honestly it just feels like I don't have time to do anything because I leave everything for the last minute, and relaxation is just stressful because I really could be doing something productive instead. I just ended up feeling so overwhelmed  I couldn't get anything done.   \n\n\nWhat's the best way for me to get back on my feet? My work ethic in high-school and first year were so much better than right now. I just don't know where to start.","6":"I feel like the university is swallowing me alive.. I'm in honors physiology. It's not that the course content is boring; it's the constant fear of tanking my GPA, not getting into my graduate study, becoming a sociopath, and losing meaningful connections for no reason. As an Asian dude, my parents said it was either Engineering, Medicine, or Law. Since Math was boring and Science nerds were prone to hating History, I said I wanted to be a doctor. Ever since, my parents have been hell-bent on me becoming one. Maybe it's something I'd wanted at first but over the years, it's something I've come to spite because of the constant fighting about my grades. In High School, it was pretty easy to finesse high 90%+ grades in something I didn't believe in and suppress their whining. But in university, I just can't. The first year I scraped by with a 3.3 but it's the second year now and I got my first C and W and have Winter Term to go. I've cut myself off from my friends. I'm in my first healthy relationship with a supportive girlfriend but that might end because I can't seem to study and date. I can't do a bunch of volunteer work or get a research placement. I've talked to advisors who've said to take a year off or do part-time or choose a different career path. The problem is Asian parents are suffocating and I'm financially dependent on them in terms of Health Care, housing, etc. I could leave and get a job, but Full-Time studying in Honors Physiology and getting a job with my shit availability seems impossible. I could go on Student Loans and go into residency, but again, I'd need to be able to pay off my debts and the way school is going I'm not sure I'd be able to.\n\nI don't know what to do. I loved physiology and it is something that interests me but my depression and lack of control over my life make it impossible to try. Has anyone else survived feeling like this?","7":"I'm so tired. How was everybody's first day back?","8":"I know UWS is usually slow to start the semester, but does it seem like it's been incredibly slow even by first week standards?. \\^","9":"Dont be that person.

My PSYCO 491 prof sent out this email (attached below) today, and I thought that this seems like a pretty fucking good deal so I thought I'd share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe course is called Topics in Evolutionary Theory in Psychology, and it's on Tuesday nights from 5-8pm. There's no midterms or final exam, no required textbook, and she's willing to wave the prereq (PSYCO 391) if you don't have it. There are only 7 people in the class right now out of a total of 38 spots. From yesterday's class, it sounded like it was going to be an easy A (plus it's 400-level credits!!).

I did my work and went to class, I had friends I would spend time with, I got fine grades, overall I was pretty content. Then everything took a turn after a few months and one stupid fucking thing that I could have prevented if I had just been more observant and less idiotic began a domino effect and my fast decline into being a horrible student, I was fucking miserable, I had trouble with my work no matter how much I would study, definitely wouldnt go to class enough, I completely closed myself off and wouldn't spend time with anyone, it was rare if u would eat at all, wouldn't get out of bed, got sick, slept too much or not at all, had shit hygiene, wouldn't clean and all that stuff is still happening to this day. It all came came to a head this past week, I had a deferred exam I know I failed which effects my classes this semester and my program as a whole and I can't even get advising time because the advisor i need is booked past the swap\/drop date. It also made me realise just how unready I am for every class I am in, it's just a matter of time before i fail those too. I have never even thought of a future where I don't graduate from university in this field but I'm not smart or strong enough to handle it or anything else. I'm watching my entire world fall apart because I couldn't even handle my first semester where I spent so much time justifying my lack of accomplishment and being all alone to stupid life events that made me depressed, I wouldnt make myself grow up and get kn with my life like I should have. I know that people will say this isn't the end of the world and doesn't mean university is over but ever single plan I had is ruined, I can't get help in time and if I did they would probably tell me everything I already know, i have no backup plans and continuing my current courses will be nothing but wasting more money than I already have to pretend i could ever get this degree in the first place.","16":"Mental Health Resources. **If you are in crisis or currently at high risk of doing harm to yourself or others, contact emergency services or the Edmonton Distress line and refer to the below-listed resources.**\n\n**Please remember that you are not alone in anything you may be going through.

If you are talking to someone who is not interested in going into medicine, then you come off as a braggart and naive. \n\nOh, and mentioning that you want to get into medicine *along with some esoteric or impressive medical specialty* makes it even more irritating. I know the journey to becoming an MD is stressful and always on your mind, but just give it a rest---in fact, doing so might be nice for your mental health.

I don\u2019t even have any of my current classmates\u2019 phone #. I stopped approaching people a long time ago after my self-esteem (which was already not that great to begin with) was shattered by a series of incidents in my 1st year. I never joined clubs or went to events. I hang out with my pre-university friends outside of school and that\u2019s about it. \n\nI recently said just \u201chi\u201d to a very shy girl from one of my classes when I ran into her on campus. The next day, I notice her walking towards me and I bolt out of the area. Why? I don\u2019t know. I hated my guts for the next two weeks for avoiding her that first day. I felt like I was probably the first person to approach her in a long time and I ruined it. I ruined her self-esteem. I ruined a friendship that could have been. What can I say, I took what happened and ran with it in my mind. Later on, I approached her again for my own sanity and to feel like I didn\u2019t contribute to ruining someone else\u2019s social life like I ruined mine.

Especially in this day and age where mental illness and depression are rampant, please make a habit of talking to new people in your class every once in a while. You may end up being someone\u2019s guardian angel and making a new best friend for life. \n\nCongratulations to anyone graduating this year. I hope your future is bright!

I feel so anxious about failing that I'm contemplating not even writing it, even though I paid almost $200. The thing is I have nothing to lose. If I bomb it, the only thing it affects is my chance at one school because only one school requires the GRE. It's not like it affects my GPA or anything else, but I am truly afraid of failure.

I know this may not be the most appropriate thread but I really need to vent about this situation because it\u2019s been bothering me for a while and I have no one else to talk to.\nI moved into off-campus student residence this fall so this has been my first time living with someone other than family. And me and my roommate were randomly assigned.Feel free to tell me if I\u2019m in the wrong , again I want a third party opinion.\n\nWhen  we moved in we had sets of rules and agreements that we talked about and I feel like she has broken every Agreement!! I wish I could  explain every one but this post will be too long so I will explain the dealbreaker.\nWhen we moved in, we agreed that when we invite guest over we would let the other person know. That only lasted a couple months. Recently she has been inviting people over all the time without telling me and I find it really rude. I pay to live here and out of respect I would like to know when someone is going to be in the dorm( my dorm is literally so small so it\u2019s also kinda awkward when a bunch of strangers are right outside your door) . One time she even had a little attitude because she was trying to bring people over (again without giving me a heads up) and I was home.?? Like it\u2019s so ridiculous. Most of the time the guests are in her room but I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t just let me know when she\u2019s bringing someone over, especially when it\u2019s a guy spending the night. Lately she has been bringing guys over to spend the night and again no heads up. I just always feel uncomfortable being at home because I\u2019m always self conscious about what I wear etc. because I never know who is coming over.\nThe last straw is I planned to come home and sleep early because I have a midterm tomorrow and I got home around  11PM from the library.

Sorry (actually sorry!). ","33":"UAlberta washroom review #4. Good evening my fellow classmates, my friends and my family. With all this ghoul talk I decided to do a little investigating myself. Since I was already picking my project material for mec e 260 in DICE I thought to myself. Is every engineer a ghoul? Will I one day grow up, with stink so unimaginable that I\u2019ll be like spongebob and have breathe that creates chaos throughout the entire city? And let me tell you ladies and ghouls. Their bathroom has shown me that there is light at the end of the tunnel. This bathroom, 10th floor of dice, is like a bathroom from heaven. The floors were bleach white that made you feel like you were in the clouds themselves. Seats so clean you don\u2019t have to worry about catching an STD. Garbage cans that weren\u2019t overflowing with paper towel. Either there is hope for ghouls, or they have the best janitors in the business. The one downside I did have with this washroom however is that there is no washroom door. The poor receptionist who is right next door probably heard everything that hit the water and more. But I didn\u2019t care. How can you care when you are pooping in heaven? All your stress and worries just vanish. This washroom gets a solid 9.5\/10. Still not perfect, but heaven isn\u2019t perfect either. One major concern, however, is getting to the 10th floor. My elevator was lucky enough to pass the 7th floor (might be 8th). For the ones who don\u2019t know, this is the ghouls headquarters. If you make this journey and come across this floor, your life may be over. So beware, my fellow peers, that if you make this journey, I am not responsible for any damage that may come to your sinus. \n\n","34":"The Children of Mr. Clean. Hello fellow members of The Alliance,\n\nI would like to open this message by commending the men and women of The Alliance for their bravery in this war. I once fought along side you, and the mental fortitude it takes to wake up every single day to face the odor of the horde is truly astounding. You all should be proud of the fight you have put up.\n\nIt is clear, however, that the traditional means of war have failed us. Even with our technological advancements in ghoul-fighting technology and brilliant strategic maneuvers conducted by the elite pre-med forces, we have not made much progress in this conflict. It is a war of attrition, and I fear that the scales will soon tip to favour the ghouls in light of our dwindling numbers.\n\nHowever, I do not wish to stand here and demoralize you all, as I bring forth a solution: a group known as \u201cThe Children of Mr. Clean\u201d. To fully understand the origins of this group, I implore you to read my account of my experiences on the 10th floor of DICE [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/comments\/alwejp\/ualberta_washroom_review_4\/efhne5d). In short though, I had an encounter with a divine entity known as Mr. Clean, and have reason to believe he could be the key to winning this war.\n\nI understand that many of you will have a hard time believing in the existence of our saviour Mr. Clean, so I have searched through the ancient archives and shall present some evidence in an attempt to convince you. While these clips may be labelled as \u201cadvertisements\u201d, let me assure you that they are 100% real footage, and that no special effects have been used.\n\n[Exhibit A](https:\/\/youtu.be\/wIRLOjDIeJ8?t=14) (0:14 - 0:22) - Mr. Clean has the ability to appear on smooth, freshly cleaned surfaces. I experienced this phenomenon first hand after seeing him in the mirror in DICE. \n\n[Exhibit B](https:\/\/youtu.be\/WeTQXmJu5Xo?t=9) (0:09 - 0:12) - Mr. Clean is so powerful that he has \u201ccaptured the sun\u201d on multiple occasions, explaining the phenomenon we know as \u201cnight\u201d.\n\n[Exhibit C](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L0YPsuZYZIY) (0:01 - 0:04) - Mr. Clean has been captured ON CAMERA in 2008 materializing out of thin air, proving his existence as a divine being. The footage later shows his partnership with febreze, which could be an essential turning point in the war.\n\nSince the beginning of time, Mr. Clean has given us all a promise in the form of a song: \u201cMr. Clean will clean your whole house\/And every room that\u2019s in it\u201d. While one may assume this only applies to one\u2019s personal dwelling, \u201chouse\u201d is in fact a metaphor for \u201ccampus\u201d, and \u201croom\u201d is a metaphor for \u201cengg buildings\u201d, which is clear when you translate the lyrics through multiple languages. If we can all band together to summon the spirit of Mr. Clean to our campus, we may be able to cleanse the ghouls and end this war once and for all!\n\nI do not expect you all to join this cause, but I believe that divine intervention may be our only hope. I personally have previous experience in leading a Pear ~~cult~~ religious group, so I assure you that you can trust me as your leader.\n\nWe have taken up residence in the upper levels of CCIS (as the clean washrooms up there are most conducive to our cleaning rituals), and we will be holding our first official gathering at 5:00pm today. Anyone is welcome to join, as long as you maintain an above average level of hygiene. Members are also encouraged to wear their cleanest, whitest shirts. We will be offering up Magic Eraser offerings, and learning to channel the power of Mr. Clean against the ghouls. I hope to see many of you there, but in the meantime, stay strong in your resolve, and may the divine winds of Febreze guide you throughout your days.","35":"Crushing hardcore.

It\u2019s happened a couple times now, and I get so anxious before them at this point that I get sick. Does anyone have any tips? ","39":"How do you make yourself feel better after an exam?. I talk to friends, eat, and cry. It works. What do you guys do?","40":"Devastated about the suicide in Schaffer tower this morning. As someone that has to go there everyday I can\u2019t imagine the pain this poor girl went through. May you Rest In Peace. And always remember there are sources on campus to get you through mental health issues.. ","41":"To my fellow UofA students. There have been a few sad posts on here lately, and I know these people are not the only ones feeling down.  To the girls and guys who are getting their heartbroken and left, to the students dealing with mental illness, to the students with no friends, the students who have a family member\/friend that is sick, the student who can't afford to eat, the student who feels too stupid to be at school and all the rest;  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have every fucking right to be determined, to feel worthy of yourself and stand your ground.   The world is not a beautiful place, it just appears that way, it is conditioned by abandonment and giving up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose we want to love we leave us, and when they go we feel they take pieces of our worth away, guess what? NO ONE can take your worth away. No one has the fucking right to come to swoon you and take pieces of you away, and you are whole all of you, the only thing that is leaving is an opportunity someone was too cowardly to take. Or maybe, you reflect rejection onto yourself and wonder and all the things you could have done differently, perhaps they don't see it that way, maybe they aren't feeling well and don't know how to express it, so they walk away. Maybe people have different kinds of eyes and see beauty in different places, and for some people, your beauty is so rare it takes the most unique pair of eyes to find you.   But that's not all. It doesn't make things better, not when they tell you 'others will come, 'you are still young,' or '(he or she) is not a good person' no that doesn't make it better. You need to know that while things, opportunities and people are leaving you and walking away, YOU are still here not giving up, YOU ARE BEING STRONG. Stand your ground and know you have every right to take up space in this world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n When you are struggling with mental illness, when you can't stop re-arranging your room, throwing up, thinking about pills...when you are onto another depressive\/manic episode you are not alone. The world wants you to quit, it almost expects you too, but FUCK that. We have our seasons, and sometimes they go on forever, you hate yourself for things you cannot always control, believe that everything is your fault and that it was a mistake you got into university, every time you reject these thoughts you get stronger. It is not your fault, each time you stand your ground and tell yourself you are not leaving, that you made it to university, equally like everyone else. This is how you get stronger. You show yourself that with every goodbye, and with every challenge, you were the one who chose to stay and even if you can't or if you already have left remember there is a place you know you can always come back too.   To the people who hate their bodies, I don't know who many times I hear people commenting on how fat they feel. You have EVERY RIGHT to eat, go to the vending machine and get a chocolate bar right now.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd by the way, to those assholes that kept calling this other student 'stupid,' screw you. You don't say, 'ignore him he's dumb' or 'how did he get into university he's so stupid.' That's not a joke; it's not funny.  It's the reason why people end up feeling so shitty about themselves and depressed. I don't care if they are laughing too, you can see it behind their eyes you took it too far.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the students out there who have lost loved ones, or parents. I know how it feels to do this alone, to graduate from high school and walk off the stage with a diploma expecting your mom to be in the audience but she isn't. While everyone is throwing their caps in the air, your throat swells. When everyone is cheering for someone, and you just want that person to be there cheering for you. Like when you got accepted to the university or got a good mark on an exam. You sit in your room crying.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut I can still say, *'look, Mom, I did it.'*   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is an emotional, sad overly dramatic post and probably full of errors, but I wanted to say something. I am sorry things suck. ","42":"I might need glasses - What do I do?. Okay, this is probably a very dumb question and I could ask it elsewhere but I don\u2019t really know where.

They have their futures planned: graduate school, marriage, travelling with friends, etc. They just know exactly what they want. They have their ups and downs, but they always seem to know how to pick themselves up. Another thing is that they look forward to graduating this year. Then there is me, worried that I have wasted four years of my life studying something that has only ever made me feel so miserable and uncertain about myself. I feel like when I graduate this year I will have left university without gaining any valuable experience and lessons.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to compare yourself to others, but how am I supposed to know if I\u2019m ok? If I am making the right choices for myself? Because clearly I am not, if choosing university has made me feel this way every day, week and year.

I\u2019m incredibly worried about them and I don\u2019t know what to do for them. I have suggested that they should talk to a therapist again (they have previously) or reach out to some other mental health resource that is available because they could really use better support than I can provide. However, they are refusing anything and everything I suggest in terms of help or support. They insist they are fine, but then they say things like above again that make me feel differently.

I don't know if this is really the right place for this but: I was so passionate about my program coming into school, I thought it was something I wanted to focus on for the rest of my life, and I had serious dreams of getting into med school. But damn man, being back from the break, I started looking at other options (NAIT's EMR\/EMT program). I won't meet the age requirements by next year, and I missed the application deadline for 2019, so I'd get to take a year off and work off some of the student loan debt. This place has been so isolating and soul crushing, and that feels like such an amazing alternative. Good starting wage, same amount of years as my program but with much more promise of a job at the end of it. Even just considering it has gave me a better sense of confidence in my classes right now because idk if I wanna stay in them now.","71":"MatE 202 Unfair Marking?. Anybody else think MatE was really unfairly marked? Like I showed work on questions and still got 0 marks. Also, I only defined symbols once on the graph question and then just wrote the symbol on the other graphs (i.e. Defined S is stress amplitude and then just wrote S on the other graph).\n\nI'm just wondering if I should go talk with the other professor and see if he marked any differently.

","75":"I went through the platforms for the sU President Candidates. It started as taking notes for myself, ended up with a decent amount of text so I figured I would share it. I originally wrote this up on a google doc so sorry if the formatting is wack here. \n\n\n**Two peeps**: Akankasha Bhatnagar, Andre Bourgeois\n\n**First Impressions from Gateway Interview:**\n\nAkanksha\n\n* Focus on holding the governments and Uni admins more accountable\n* Continue advocating for affordable education\n* Get students involved earlier in their degree (I really like this as I can personally relate with sk\u2019lub exec in my 2nd year which really allowed me to grow as an individual. Also most clubs on campus suffer from a high turnover rate because of people joining late in their degrees)\n* Work-integrated learning (who doesn\u2019t want to get a job)\n* Comes across as very goal oriented, with specific objectives to complete\n\nAndre\n\n* Continue making noticeable changes for students on campus\n* Complete student charter of rights (idk what\u2019s left on that)\n* Advocate for mental health services + sexual violence risk\n* Improve transparency and accountability of SU (general statement imo)\n* Mentions mental health a lot during this interview.\n\nNeither candidate mentioned that Shaggy would easily be able to defeat Thanos,\nAkansha gave a pretty political-like response, Andre did embrace the non-seriousness of\nthe question.\n\n \n\n**Platform Breakdown**\n\nFirst off, why is it so hard to find the platforms? There isn\u2019t anything on\nsu.ualberta.ca\/vote, if I type in \u201cAkanksha Bhatnagar (or Andre Bourgeois) SU elections\nplatform\u201d into google I just get the Gateway Interview, searching the names up on\nFacebook leads to their respective VP pages (this might just be on Facebook though). I\nended up going through an invite to like her facebook page\n(https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/VoteAkanksha), finding a link to her site which then had the\nplatform (https:\/\/voteakanksha.com\/platform). Just have the platforms on the SU site\npeople... (like there isn\u2019t even anything about the elections on the homepage of the SU\nsite)\n\n\n**Akanksha**\n\n* Ngl, looove the pink theme of the document\n\n\u201cThe Student Experience\u201d\n\n1.1: Champion Student Voices\n\n* It\u2019s nice to complete a survey to send out to students for data\ncollection, but what\u2019s the plan if you only have a small amount of\nstudents who complete the survey? How will you get people to\ncomplete it? How do you plan on communicating the results to the\nUniversity Gov?\n\n1.2: Support Indigenous Student Advocacy\n\n* It is nice to mention that she was a member and has worked with the ARRC in the past.\n\n1.3: Provide Free Menstrual Products for all Students\n\n* How is this not a thing already? Seriously?\n\n\u201cA Students\u2019 Union for All Students\u201d\n\n2.1 Promote an Equitable Campus\n\n* Not too much to comment here, she helped develop the EDI strategic plan, it would make sense for her to make sure it plays out.\n\n2.2 Connect You to Your Students\u2019 Union\n\n* All I really got from this is that she wants to do target marketing to students about SU services and events\n* I don\u2019t know if I would really want to have SU anything marketed at me when I\u2019m standing in line for my bus pass personally.\n\n2.3 Support our Student Leaders\n\n* Advocating for having a more diverse group of applicants for leadership positions is a huge plus in my book.\n* I was looking forward for what she had in mind based off her comments in the Gateway interview, but the second section of this part of the platform was pretty lackluster. It went from promoting leadership positions to new(er) students, to support a select group of students in governance positions. This pretty much disregards every student who is in a leadership position in the plethora of clubs across campus who (in my bias opinion as one of these individuals) has more of a direct impact on the student life then those in governance positions.\n\n\u201cLooking to a Sustainable Future\u201d\n\n3.1 Increase Work-Integrated Learning Opportunities\n\n* This is an important topic, although I do not personally know how any of the programs mentioned work or the impact they have on students. (degree relevant) Student employment seems to be on a faculty basis instead of being an overarching problem (from my perspective)\n\n3.2 Advocate for an Affordable Education\n\n* I like the push to get students who are not as involved with campus activities to be able to be eligible for scholarships.\n* Most of this part is related to just advocating for things (hence the heading), which is tough since it\u2019s out of her control.\n\n3.3 Implement a Cultural Lens in Wellness Services\n\n* This section had a pretty weak \u201chow\u201d section, it felt like it was just a \u201coh yeah I should mention something about mental health\u201d.\n* The SU can\u2019t really do much than advocate for awareness though, it would be cool to allow for more control of it. Especially with how poor these services are on campus.\n\n\n**Andre**\n\n* Also couldn\u2019t find the platform anywhere online, had to go to his poster to find the\nsite ( http:\/\/andreforpresident.ca\/ )\n- First skim gave the impression of a more detailed platform, with specific points\nalong with sources.\n\nDefend Student Rights\n\n- Complete the Charter of Student Rights\n- Gave some detail into what this is (which is nice because I had no\nidea)\n- States the process that needs to occur for it to be completed\n- Not really too sure of the point of the case study, since it wasn\u2019t\nactually a case study just a mention of some stuff McGill has on\ntheir Charter\n\nHold the University accountable to their commitments to improve student\nlife\n\n- Just outlines the goals that have been set by the administration\n- Sure raising awareness of the failures of the admin is great, but\nawareness isn\u2019t action. *(side note: this is a pretty major issue on\nAkanksha\u2019s platform also. Lots of awareness and advocating but\nno clear methods to produce results that will actually impact\nstudents)*\n- This is a pretty important issue for me, so maybe one of the\ncandidates for VP student life will cover it in more detail (hopefully)\n\nWork to integrate fair, student-centric practices into University appeals\nand disputes\n\n- Again, more advocating. However, the SU doesn\u2019t actually have\nany control over the Sexual Assault Centre so there isn\u2019t much\nmore a Pres can do.\n\nIncrease the Value and Affordability of Education\n\n- Gives a detailed breakdown of university spending and budget increases\n- Fight unnecessary costs students such as textbooks and accessibility\nresources\n- I\u2019m probably just getting tired from reading the platforms, but like\nagain with the advocating.. I\u2019m just not sold on it.\n\nPromote improvements to student spaces, with a particular focus on good\nseating and more outlets\n\n- This section was a lot of fluff, like yes I get it. It\u2019s an issue. Unfortunately it\nis out of the SU hands so the most he can do is (suprise suprise)\nadvocate for things.\n\nStrengthen the Students\u2019 Union\n\n- Increase executive and operation accountability by publishing an annual projects\nreport\n- I like the promotion of transparency of the SU. A lot of students (including\nmyself) have a vibe that the SU doesn\u2019t really do anything (honestly\nreading these platforms isn\u2019t selling me on moving from this opinion)\n\nEnsure students get the services they pay for by expanding SU communications\n\n- Promote and improve accessibility to services that SU provides (and\nstudents pay for)\n- Neato, cheeto.\n\nHelping Students\u2019 Council Succeed\n\n- In my opinion, this impacts such a small group of students.. Like why\nwould you put this on your platform as a major point.\n- Also there is a typo. Check yo q\u2019s Andre.\n- You know who also deserves better SWAG? The rest of the student\npopulation.\n- How much does the SU contribute to these retreats and other benefits\nthat the council and similar smaller groups of students get? This section\ngets a massive L for me.\n\nThe remainder of the platform goes over Andre\u2019s Key Strategic Areas. This is just\nmore advocating for things that are extremely broad and big picture (personal\nopinion), I don\u2019t really see any of these things being successfully advocated for in\nthe term.","76":"Is there a spot on campus to test for aDHD?.

Maybe now people just see the deadness in my eyes and I seem unapproachable but I'd like to think that I still seem like a decent person to come up to and strike a convo with.

I am best at multiple choice exams, and hate written response tests because, idk about you, but I feel that a lot of the questions are ambiguous to me and I can never get EXACTLY EVERYTHING that they want into my answers and end up with a lower mark just because I didn\u2019t interpret the whole question the way the prof wanted it.

If grade school is supposed to prepare you for university, and university is a series of standardized testing, and if there are less standardized tests occurring and rising mental health concerns within university, doesn't that say something?. Not a UCP supporter, just a thought ","112":":) Friendly ol' discussion time. I've been thinking about this reddit a lot (hahaha sad ): ) but I genuinely wonder why people are so fast to hop on posts complaining about problematic behaviors on campus with 'DID YOU GO UP AND CONFRONT THEM YOURSELF? LOL STOP COMPLAINING'\n\nI get that probably a lot of the time, the OP hasn't confronted whatever problematic person there was. But that's not exactly their job to begin with and I'm trying to be understanding of people. People often forget if you try to confront someone, the other party always has the possibility of being resentful and retaliating. So it might just be a better idea to deal with a temporary minor inconvenience. Sometime's it's just nice to vent your frustrations out and it's always nice to know other people have been in your situation. I feel like people who jump on these kinds of posts are being hypocritical in a way - it's way easier to tell someone off online because there isn't a face connected with our accounts here.\n\nThis subreddit doesn't move super fast anyway so it's not like those types of threads are taking up any real estate in the long run.  I'm definitely trying my best not to be preachy but I think being a little nicer to each other really takes pretty much no time and energy.\n\n&lt;3 have a good night guys\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","113":"You come here often?. I started an Instagram account called @youcomehereoften__ (it has two underscores). \nThe account @youcomehereoften__ features conversations I\u2019ve had with people (most of them are ualberta or uofc students) I share their stories and the goal is to hopefully help someone out there feel a little less alone. The stories range from stories about mental health, light-hearted talks and experiences with things like moving out, starting uni, silly things someone has done, etc. The first two posts on the page explains the account in detail. If you want to support the page by following it or getting the word out there about it\u2019s existence it\u2019d mean the world to me. Here\u2019s a quote from it:\n\n\u201cI remember being a little kid and sitting down on a train...I used to think trains were the coolest things ever because you just got to go past the world and it was all a blur. As I got a bit older I would always sit on the train and look around at people...everyone does this\u2026 you just kind of wonder what everyone\u2019s story is. Especially if you look at a hotel building or an abandoned house...you just wonder about the people that lived there and what it was like before. I thought this project was an interesting way to talk to people and see if they wanted to share any aspect of their story or something that\u2019s happened in their life that\u2019s affected them. I want it to be more of a conversation than anything. The older you get, the harder it is to stay in contact with friends and most friendships are very surface level. You go to lectures and talk about what\u2019s due and sometimes you don\u2019t even know the person\u2019s name. People just don\u2019t really have conversations anymore. I wanted this project to be a way to have conversations with people I meet and it doesn\u2019t have to be serious\u2026 you don\u2019t have to tell my your deepest darkest secret\u2026.you just have to hold a conversation.\u201d","114":"What are my chances at successfully appealing the RTW?.

It takes me hours to get through planning a single lesson and my lessons still end up running short, leaving me scrambling for a filler activity. I have only attended one brief meeting for an extra curricular so I'm concerned I won't pass because of that. I'm trying really hard to be motivated but I'm pretty sure I have depression and it's really taking all energy out of me right. It's not that I don't want to teach necessarily, I'm just concerned that the level of anxiety I'm feeling means that I am not cut out for it or that my depression is keeping me from being the best teacher I can be. I'm considering withdrawing, frankly so I can relax and start properly treating my depression before returning (if I choose to do so), but I've already spent so much time in and out of school that taking more time off seems equally as stressful.

Im gonna get major hate for this but im gonna tell it as it is.\n\nAnyway, as you all know i dont know shit all about the UCP. But from what I heard the biggest concern on this sub is that they plan on eliminating the tuition cap. So of course most people are freaking out about this and what not. But in all honesty, why is raising tuition costs such a bad thing? \n\nBefore explaining it is worth being honest in that I am very wealthy so I won't be affected by tuition increases. But even if i was poorer i wouldn't mind higher tuition prices. This is because of several reasons. \n\nFirst, i feel that students have no right to tell the universities \"*oh you can't charge whatever you want*\". Moreover, why should the government have a right to tell the university to limit their prices? The university knows what it needs much better than the students and any government. We shouldn't limit the university's desire to expand, give raises, offer more programs just because students aren't willing to pay slightly more than they already do. Plus, it's incredibly entitled for students to ask the government \"*please cap tuition because I'm too lazy to actually think about my career and pay back the money I took out.*\" Nobody is forcing you to go to university, if you go to university you adopt all risks and rewards. YOU need to take responsibility for your career and education. \n\nOften times the university simply gets grants from government, so taxpayers, or they just deduct potential raises\/work hours\/future employees to compensate for the inability to raise tuition costs. Not every UofA employee is a professor, so not everyone is making hundreds of thousands of dollars. Think about the janitors, electricians, HVAC, cooks, lister staff, and other workers who are hurt from the inability to raise tuition costs.\n\nUniversity is an investment in your future and with all investment comes with an ROI and comes with risk. Higher tuition costs mean that students hopefully will consider their future and their studies before jumping into low paying programs like Drama or Political Science. I think avrg cost is like $10,000 per year for those programs? If the average cost became $40,000 per year, maybe some of these kids would reconsider going into those programs and go into something with a better ROI like trades, nursing or anything else well paying. \n\nThird, higher tuition costs promote personal responsibility. We all know that many kids abuse their loans and just shit around in university. Not everyone obviously, but there are a ton of people at university who aren't smart enough nor have the work ethnic appropriate for university. While I party a bunch I still give a shit about my studies. I Don't drink on weekdays, and i dont screw around as many other do, but too many students waste all this money and have no personal responsibility for their growth, their studies or their future. I think higher tuition costs would offset this because they would reconsider going to university if the total cost would be like $180,000 rather than $40,000 or something. So they'd get the \"*oh shit*\" feeling rather than the \"*oh $40,000 isn't that bad I can easily pay that off.*\" \n\nI'm prepared for the backlash but this is my position and I stand by it. Take responsibility for your life and stop complaining about paying slightly more tuition. Tuition has been rising in most countries and if you're so concerned drop out and do a trade or some shit. When you take out a mortgage or a car loan you take out risk, no one is forcing you to do either. You can live very well without a university degree, so you shouldn't complain about what that university is charging you. \n\nAdditionally, if we had higher tuition prices there would likely be less students in university. This a good thing. The students would be the most academically achieving. And most students who are high achieving aren't susceptible to depression\/stress associated with university (yes this isnt' always the case i know). This means less mental health problems from university which is a good thing in itself.\n\nFinally, if you really want to complain you should demand that the university cut spending so tuition costs can decrease. Other than yesterday (with the Gateway) nobody ever complains that the university is spending too much money. Maybe start by cutting actual programs\/courses that have a poor financial ROI for graduates (*guess for yourself which those are*). Maybe cut all the sports teams, fitness centers, SU, and other unproductive shit that is just bureaucracy and an excuse to overcharge students. If we cut enough of those programs maybe we wouldn't need a tuition cap in the first place. \n\nI look forward to the next government removing the tuition cap.","140":"Need to get this off my chest - I hope the university raises tuition costs.

Plus, it's incredibly entitled for students to ask the government \"*please cap tuition because I'm too lazy to actually think about my career and pay back the money I took out.*\" Nobody is forcing you to go to university, if you go to university you adopt all risks and rewards. YOU need to take responsibility for your career and education.\n\nAlso, by limiting the universities ability to increase costs you are hurting university employees. Not all employees make hundreds of thousands of dollars and are professors. By limiting the university's ability to raise tuition costs you are likely causing a reduction of hours, raises, future hiring and benefits. Consider the cooks, electricians, HVAC, security and all the other jobs which are affected when universities cant hike prices.\n\nUniversity is an investment in your future and with all investment comes with an ROI and comes with risk. Higher tuition costs mean that students hopefully will consider their future and their studies before jumping into low paying programs like Drama or Political Science. I think avrg cost is like $10,000 per year for those programs? If the average cost became $40,000 per year, maybe some of these kids would reconsider going into those programs and go into something with a better ROI like trades, nursing or anything else well paying.\n\nThird, higher tuition costs promote personal responsibility. We all know that many kids abuse their loans and just shit around in university. Not everyone obviously, but there are a ton of people at university who aren't smart enough nor have the work ethnic appropriate for university. While I party a bunch I still give a shit about my studies. Too many students waste all this money and have no personal responsibility or their growth, their studies or their future. I think higher tuition costs would offset this because they would reconsider going to university if the total cost would be like $180,000 rather than $40,000 or something. So they'd get the \"*oh shit*\" feeling rather than the \"*oh $40,000 isn't that bad I can easily pay that off.*\"\n\nI'm prepared for the backlash but this is my position and I stand by it. Take responsibility for your life and stop complaining about paying slightly more tuition. Tuition has been rising in most countries and if you're so concerned drop out and do a trade or some shit. When you take out a mortgage or a car loan you take out risk, no one is forcing you to do either. You can live very well without a university degree, so you shouldn't complain about what that university is charging you.\n\nAdditionally, if we had higher tuition prices there would likely be less students in university. This a good thing. The students would be the most academically achieving. And most students who are high achieving aren't susceptible to depression\/stress associated with university (yes this isnt' always the case i know). This means less mental health problems from university which is a good thing in itself.\n\nFinally, if you really want to complain you should demand that the university cut spending so tuition costs can decrease. Other than yesterday (with the Gateway) nobody ever complains that the university is spending too much money. Maybe start by cutting actual programs\/courses that have a poor financial ROI for graduates (*guess for yourself which those are*). Maybe cut all the sports teams, fitness centers, SU, and other unproductive shit that is just bureaucracy and an excuse to overcharge students. If we cut enough of those programs maybe we wouldn't need a tuition cap in the first place.","151":"how to improve terrible GPA.

My heart's still pounding and my anxiety is so bad I feel like throwing up. Growing up with child abusers, my parents indoctrinated me to think that getting mental health counselling was bad and if I ever tried to get any, they'd put me in the foster care system. It's so hard for me to ask for help as a result of that. I'd tried therapy in high school and it was an absolute gift; but my psychologist had moved away when first year started. My girlfriend in first year tried getting me to go to the CCS because my depression and anxiety were out of control. I went in and they had to turn down my walk-in. That really messed me up but I was fine.\n\nOver the next few months, I scheduled appointments but had to cancel because a relative had gotten cancer the day of, my mom was catching wind of my activities, and just university got in the way. After two years, I finally got the courage yesterday to call the CCS and make an appointment I was determined to attend. The receptionist ended up listing all my \"cancellations\" and there was such contempt in her voice, I felt my heart sink. It was so damn hard to make that call and she made me feel like someone who did not deserve help because life got in the way of my appointments to better myself. Even before I gave her my ID number, she sounded aggravated and I couldn't pinpoint why.\n\nIs this a normal?

One should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.\n&gt;\n&gt;2.

One\u2019s body is inviolable, subject to one\u2019s own will alone.\n&gt;\n&gt;4. The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend.\n&gt;\n&gt;5. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n&gt;\n&gt;6. Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. We should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit our beliefs.\n&gt;\n&gt;7. People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and remediate any harm that may have been caused.\n&gt;\n&gt;Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought.\n&gt;\n&gt;The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.\n&gt;\n&gt;The mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense and justice, and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will. Politically aware, Civic-minded Satanists and allies in The Satanic Temple have publicly opposed The Westboro Baptist Church, advocated on behalf of children in public school to abolish corporal punishment, applied for equal representation where religious monuments are placed on public property, provided religious exemption and legal protection against laws that unscientifically restrict women's reproductive autonomy, exposed fraudulent harmful pseudo-scientific practitioners and claims in mental health care, and applied to hold clubs along side other religious after school clubs in schools besieged by proselytizing organizations.\n\nYou may have heard of TST in the news lately as they've just been granted tax exempt status as a religion from the IRS, the first satanic organization to do so! \n\nAnyways, I just thought I'd see if anyone else out there would be interested in forming a new student group.

Seriously consider seeing a therapist-- they know how to help with everyday or \"boring\" stressors and concerns too! put YOURSELF as a Priority.. I have been reading and hearing a lot about people who are scared about entering university for the first time (or coming back!) or who might be uncertain about their future, already feel like they are falling behind or are just experiencing a significant life change. Maybe they don't have their same group of friends, maybe they now are living on their own all of a sudden, perhaps they are torn about taking a 5 course load, etc.\n\n**These are normal (gl defining normal though) feelings for many people to experience.** Talking to a lot of people there is a barrier of \"Oh you need to be depressed to seek out therapy\/help. Or you need to have crippling anxiety.\", but this is an absolutely false misconception. Therapists are educated across a massive variety of topics ranging from PTSD treatment all the way to helping someone cope with a salty coworker who ate their lunch last Tuesday.\n\n*No life situations or feelings are \"too mundane\" or \"not important enough\".* Honestly I'd say stepping into university and the absolute deluge of issues that comes with it are VERY relatable concerns that many people have been through.\n\nIf you are feeling any sort of way PLEASE reach out. That's the best advice I think I could have given 1st year me who was pretty overwhelmed and stressed to the max.\n\n*Oh. And don't feel bad about only taking a 3 or 4 course load if you can.* In fact for first years who can do it I'd personally strongly advise a 3 course load first semester to adjust. Doing summer courses or taking another year is far from a bad thing and has a stigma for utterly ridiculous reasons imho.\n\n-&gt; Burnout is real. VERY real.\n\n-&gt; Needing time for your own hobbies, passions and pursuits is core. Don't forget that you are more than just your education, career, and your GPA. \n\n-&gt; Plenty of people make significant life and career changes later in life. If you are brand new and only 18 years old worrying about graduating at 23 vs. 22 I can tell you this for a fact... almost no one will possibly care that you took an extra year or two or even three to finish a degree. \n\n**I'll end this with something a project lead of mine once said to me when they saw me hitting burnout and getting sick and being worn into the ground.**\n\n*\"No one can take care of you but you.\"*\n\nOf course that sounds at first glance as cold and callous. But listen, of course there will be minor exceptions for some fortunate people who have their parents and such around now. But don't be tricked into thinking that anyone can actually take care of you but yourself. This is a truth and a realization I suppose I wish I had much, much earlier than I actually did. While that might seem \"sad\" or \"helpless\", there is liberation in knowing the truth. And a sense of agency and self-responsibility that comes alongside it.\n\n-&gt; No job will take care of you, the same person who said that ultimately laid me off due to business financial issues. You're there to provide a service.\n\n-&gt; If you do 80 hours of studying and work and burn out guess who cares? No one. The world will continue to spin, people will continue to go on vacations, buy houses and have children and their lives will go on without you.  If you burnout and drop out from your degree no one can help you.\n\n-&gt; If you lose things that make you happy or that make you \"you\" no one can help you reclaim them but yourself. Say you're like me and stop going to the gym, stop doing yoga, let your social media channels with thousands of subs die out-- who was to blame for that? Me. And I can't suddenly go back in time and change what I've lost.\n\n\nSo seriously, do yourself a favor and seek an actual expert to help guide you to success. :) Doesn't matter how boring\/mundane the issue is, if you're feeling some sort of way let a person who studied it for years assist.\n\n.#stuffishouldmakeayoutubechannelabout.","240":"This is maybe the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen. ","241":"Interested in joining a study group for incoming science students?. I've been thinking about forming a study group with some users here who are in their first year science just like me. I'm looking for 8 members at most. The main focus will be on CHEM 101 and BIOL 107. Here are some necessary readings for you if you are considering to join this study group, read it thoroughly before you PM me:\n\n(1) Everyone of us, as incoming students, is in the same situation as one another; we often get lost with what things to do, how to get things done, and what strategies to use in the beginning of our uni life. Being accompanied by each other, however, we will be fortified and be able to deal with lots of disturbing issues, concerns, and questions together. Not to mention the mental comfort this group will give you through breaking isolation.\n\n(2) We REQUIRE your strong passion to help each other and desire to succeed in your courses and ECs along with us through the entire semester! Our academic objective is As(I know this is almost impossible, but the higher you aim in the first place the higher your achievments will be in the end) for all the courses we study together!\n\n(3) The most important aspect in founding a sustainable study group, in my opinion, is your responsibility to be responsive. My experiences with previous few attempts to form one always have suggested that prompt and consistent communication between the members is essential and it eventually keeps the group going continuously and solid. Always keep in mind to reply your group members as soon as they text you if you can; it might be an emergency.\n\n(4) I'm thinking of making this group study a daily routine. Whoever is done with all their courses for each day will go to a designated place(whcih will be discussed in the group chat or in the real meeting) and try to occupy some seats for the rest(or we can just book a room in the library). Then the rest will gradually join and will stay together up until night(time will be flexible). Of course you can leave anytime you want whatever reason or excuse you have. Also attendance is not mandatory.\n\n(4.1) How this group works roughly looks like this(any change can be made to this in the future):\n1. Reading(reviewing) Materials(individual)\n2. Asking Questions(together)\n3. Solving Problems(individual)\n4. Asking Questions(together)\n\nVery simple and not much physical talk is involved during the process. But we should always keep this in mind in order to get things organized! We may go over this in the group chat or meeting later on.\n\n(5) Not only limited to academics, we will also try to get engaged in various activities together as long as it does not violate your other schedules and interactions with other friends. For example, we might be workout buddies and volunteer buddies at the same time!\n\n(6) Although I specifically mentioned \"science students\" above, regardless of your faculty, as long as you have one science elective at least in common with us, you can feel free to joins us. By the way, the more courses we have in common, the more likely we will be efficient as we can cover more stuff together. Note: I have BIOL 107, CHEM 101, MATH 144, PHYS 114, and LING 101.\n\n(7) Further details(location and time of study, and rules, etc.) will be discussed all together in the group chat(or we can have a meeting in real, this would indeed be a more efficient way to get things clear) I will create as soon as a minimum of 4 members is reached. I will use reddit initially to create the group chat then probably move to another platform if anyone suggests.\n\n(7.1) If you think you can't attend this meeting after our decision has been made on the date and time, always let others know in advance. Attendance for the first meeting is mandatory; most of our decisions about the basics of this student group will be made at the meeting, meaning that you should be able to express your own voice at the meeting so you won't be disadvantaged in the future.\n\n(8) As for electronics use, you are recommended to put them away while we study UNLESS you use them for academic purposes.\n\n(9) You can join and quit anytime you want.\n\nTo put all of this short: I'm recruiting a maximum of 8 members in their first year science for a study group. PM me to join if interested! In your very first text, you are expected to include your name, faculty, program, and your class schedule for fall 2019. Recommended(almost required) courses are: CHEM 101 and BIOL 107.\n\nWell I wrote quite a lot. But really the ultimate purpose of this study group is to stop ourselves from procrastinating.

I just can't seem to find people that I feel would be good friends. There are the occasional classmates that are really friendly and I can see myself being friends with them, but either they are a year older than me and graduate soon or they just don't want to talk in class. I'm not that socially awkward or anything but I feel like I've been rejected by my peers so many times, especially when I was younger, so I'm too afraid to attempt to make friends.. It's this weird thing where I want friends but at the same time I'm too scared to fully open up to people. i never really feel like I'm fully being myself because I'm afraid they're going to hurt me in some way. it's kind of pathetic but it's really difficult especially on the weekends and stuff when I see all these people going out with their friends - not that I have that great of a desire to go out or anything, but just seeing the company and relationships that other people have makes me feel really sad. I bury myself in classes and schoolwork so I usually don't really have time to think about it, but there are times, such as like the weekends, or on days where things just don't go well, when I start thinking about this.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what I want to do but I'm not really a 'clubs' type of person and I don't really do anything other than school.. I know I need to find something to do but I'm afraid that I won't be able to balance my classes and extracurriculars. it sounds ridiculous because i know a lot of people balance school with a job, extracurriculars, volunteering, etc. etc. etc. but I am just not one of those people because as a science student some of my courses I feel I'm super slow in and I literally spend hours trying to understand some concepts. it drives me nuts and I will plan to get a decent amount of work done in one day and I spend almost the whole day after classes on one or two things... I have a decent GPA but my main problem is time management.. when I feel overwhelmed I feel like I can't get anything done bc the stress is too much to bear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally wrote so much but I honestly just needed to rant and say all of this...btw I know my title to this post is way different than everything i just said, but I really do feel like UofA students are not that friendly. maybe it's just because of the experiences that I've had, but seriously, when you walk past people on campus they  barely even look at each other or talk to people other than their friends. everyone's so focused on being better than everyone else especially in labs don't even get me started.............. sigh","262":"Study\/Motivation. Out of curiosity, how does one stay motivated throughout the semester. I am a chronic procrastinator who lives by the mentality that I do my best work last minute. That does have some truth to it, as its the time when I must remain completely focused and get my work finished on time. That being said, it would be nice to not have to stress write\/read all my work the night before. My struggle is that I always find something \"better\" to do than my homework, and even when I sit down to do it, I always get distracted or deterred from my work. Does anyone have any tips\/suggestions for how they motivate themselves to get their work done?

Greetings and salutations! I am here to explain to any prospective students what the Radiation Therapy program is here at the U of A and why you might be interested in applying. I will focus on outlining what Radiation Therapists do, how to get into the program, and how things will look once you get in.\n\n\n**What is Radiation Therapy?:**\n\nSo the curious and unknowing bunch that clicked on this guide might have two initial questions right off the bat, being: What is Radiation Therapy? and: The U of A has a Radiation Therapy Program?\nRadiation therapy is an integral part of patient care specific to cancer patients. You probably have heard of chemotherapy and how it is used to treat cancer, but Radiation Therapy is just another way that cancer can be treated. Instead of a systemic approach where chemotherapy affects the whole body, radiation therapy provides a more targeted approach in which radiation in the form of high energy x-rays is delivered to the cancer site. The role of radiation therapists is to operate the machines that deliver the treatments, while providing general patient care in a clinical-like setting. As a student, you will be learning about cancer biology, radiation physics and patient-care principles that are all essential to becoming a radiation therapist.\nThe radiation therapy program is relatively new, having been around for 5 years as of now. The program is situated within the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, where interprofessional collaboration is a key aspect of the program. Admission to the program requires you to take a year of pre-professional study time (or not, if you already have the required credits), following the course requirements outlined by the program. Once you have fulfilled all the credit requirements, you will then need to write a letter of intent, as well as go through an MMI process (both of which I will describe later). What\u2019s unique about the program that is not likely to be found throughout the rest of the university is that the cohort size is roughly around 9-10, meaning a small class size with the same people throughout all your classes. With such a small class size, this also means that student-educator interactions are much more personable. \n\n\n**Credit Requirements:**\n\nAs per the website, there are different credit requirements for wherever you are planning to apply from:\nFor U of A students, the list is as follows:\n\nSTATS 151\n\nBIOL 107 &amp; CELL 201\n\nENGL 1XX\n\nCHEM 101\n\nCHEM 261\n\nMATH 113 or 114\n\nPHYS 124\n\nPHYS 126\n\nPSYCO 104 or SOC 100,101,102\n\nFor outside students, the list is as follows:\n\nStatistics (3 credits)\n\nCell Biology (6 credits)\n\nEnglish (3 credits)\n\nGeneral Chemistry (3 credits)\n\nOrganic Chemistry (3 credits)\n\nCalculus Math (3 credits)\n\nPhysics (6 credits)\n\nPsychology\/Sociology (3 credits)\n\nI personally can\u2019t speak for all the U of A specific classes, as they are general-stream courses and everyone\u2019s experience with different professors will vary. There are many good discussions about these classes throughout the subreddit, and I suggest you go look at those to get some more information. However, don\u2019t hesitate to send a message my way if you are still curious about the program requirements. \n\n\n**Career Reflection Letter:**\n\nThe general idea behind this letter is that it is acting as a letter of intent to prove your commitment to the program and what it stands for. It is important that it is both personalized and relevant to health-care and cancer patients in general. Outlining why the Radiation Therapy program stood out to you, as well as what you bring to the table as a potential future radiation therapist is also necessary. All in all, you should be honest in your writing, as this is not your typical English 102 or 103 essay, but more like peering into your thoughts and seeing you as an individual. \n\n\n**MMI:**\n\nOnce you submit your career reflection letter and move onto the next step of the process, you will be invited to attend an MMI session. This is very similar to any other MMIs you might have attended or heard about in other programs that also require MMIs as a part of the application process. For the uninformed, MMIs are just a series of interview-style questions that challenges the students problem-solving and critical thinking skills. There are a variety of MMI questions banks online that are quite helpful, and I would suggest looking through them for practice or even going through mock interviews on YouTube to gauge how to approach it. Again, if you have any more in-depth questions about how the MMI process will go, feel free to send me a message and I can explain the process in more detail.\n\n\n**Others:**\n\nTo be honest, GPA is a fairly small part of what they are looking for. As there is no official GPA minimum outlined by the program, don\u2019t stress if you are struggling a bit in your classes! It is important to understand that both the letter and MMI play a role in determining your acceptance, and not just determined by your GPA.\n\nFrom personal experience, there is quite a mix of applicants who either already have a degree or are coming directly out of high-school to apply to this program. Wherever you find yourself, there are no advantages to whether or not you already have a degree, as what you are about to learn is very specialized and unique to the program. The only bonus I would say exists is that if you have already completed a degree and have already gotten credits for a set course in the program schedule like Physl 210, meaning that you do not have to retake the course. \nJumping on what was said in the last point, if you did take the outlined courses a while ago but still wish to apply, have no fear! The courses you are about to take aren\u2019t full continuations of the prerequisite courses. What you are about to learn is fairly independent of what you previously learned. The courses just act as a learning foundation, so if you already took them then you should still have enough of a conceptual understanding to do fine in the program classes. \n\n\n**Acceptance:**\n\nCongrats! As a part of the Faculty of Med and Dent, you\u2019ll be going through the same orientation as everyone in the faculty, and once you\u2019re finally on your own, things start to settle down. Again, I won\u2019t talk too much about the courses, but I will direct you to the website to get an idea of what you should expect in the upcoming years: (https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/medicine\/programs\/radiation-therapy\/program-info\/outline). These courses are unique in the sense that it is basically in-school training for your job. Almost everything you learn as a part of your course load serves a function to teach you about the fundamentals of being a radiation therapist, along with sufficient knowledge about cancer care to set you up for the upcoming clinical years. \n\n\n**Practicum:**\n\nPracticums essentially outline what you will experience as a radiation therapist in a clinical setting. They take place at the end of your first year in the program, for a month, and for the entirety of your third year in the program. Basically, you will be working alongside actual radiation therapists while honing your practical skills as a part of your didactic requirements. From personal experience, I can say that this is easily the most fulfilling part of the entire program, as you will greatly impact and connect with cancer patients along their journey through treatment.\n\n\n**Misc:**\n\nAlong the way, there are still a variety of additional lessons that you will have to go through. Things like CPR training and interdisciplinary seminars are all a part of the program but are relevant additions that you will find to be useful for comprehensive purposes. \n\n\nThat\u2019s essentially it! We are a small program with big aspirations, so if I\u2019ve outlined some things that seem intriguing to you then I hope you take the initiative to look more into applying. If you\u2019ve actually made it this far reading then thank you as well, and I hope you all have a rad year!","270":"LOVE ADVICE PLEASE!!!.

Basically, this one class has dragged me down to the pits of hell. I spend nearly all my time on STATS and therefore have zero time to focus on my other courses (i have 2 midterms next week in other classes I haven\u2019t even began to study for.) Because of my focus on STATS, my GPA in my other courses have begun to suffer and I am behind in EVERYTHING. After all of this, my understanding of STATS is no clearer; i am still struggling immensely. I do not see a tutor being helpful as I had many math tutors in high school which didn\u2019t help my understanding at all. I had a mental breakdown tonight because i am so stressed. I\u2019m barely eating, I don\u2019t consume more than 700 calories on a good day. I don\u2019t sleep, I get around 4-6 hours every night, which is always interrupted because i wake up in the middle of the night with nausea. I feel physically exhausted and weak by the end of the day, feeling like I am going to pass out by the evening. I get daily headaches and I cant focus at all.

Disclaimer: I know this is the UofA subreddit but considering the extremely high frequency of messages I get about people trying to get in contact with mental health services or how to move forward or dealing with self harm issues and general university stress... I think it's relevant here. \n\n----------------\n\nI have gotten a lot of messages from people (10 in past few days...) saying how they aren't sure the therapist they are with is working with them or how sometimes the therapist is making things worse.\n\nI don't think it's said often enough: Not every therapist is right for everyone.\n\nDon't feel ashamed or afraid or scared to seek a different therapist. Heck, approaches between them even can vary quite dramatically. A more psychodynamic or insight-based approach might work far better for you than rigorous cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It's more than normal to seek other therapists. Some therapists don't establish rapport correctly or have a very different style than others, even within the same discipline such as CBT one therapist might be more \"on edge and hyper\" and another may be more \"docile caring and supportive\".\n\nPlus, and while this might be \"scalding hot take\" for some people, just like LITERALLY ANY PROFESSION, there are some therapists that are actually horrifically inept or just flat out rude and powertrip. Based on some of the messages I've seen... But that's just life. Just because someone has a piece of paper doesn't mean they actually care\/try for you. Fact of life, the sooner you come to accept that the better.\n\nBut point is, if things aren't working with one then try another.

Please do not give unsolicited advice because there are professionals to go to.  **However, if they ask for advice go for it.**  The thing is what works for one person might not work for others.  For, example exercise can make those who have body image problems worse.

So I\u2019ve recently heard that there\u2019s a protest about the recent budget cuts. \n\nThe cuts suck. I\u2019ve always voted Liberal or NDP and I\u2019m really disappointed to see how negatively it\u2019s going to impact our university.\n\nHowever, I think it\u2019s embarrassing that people think that protesting will do anything. Protesting is absolutely pointless against conservatives because cutting social programs is the core value of all conservatives. This is what they do. \n\n(I could maybe see some value in protesting against a Liberal or NDP government, but I think it\u2019ll be a total waste of time against a conservative government. )\n\nI\u2019ve heard rumours of certain programs being cut and it really hurts to hear. It\u2019s going to be hard and I hope for the best for everyone. \n\nNext time there\u2019s an election, we\u2019ve really gotta stop demeaning and insulting conservatives by calling them \u201cracists\u201d, \u201cuneducated\u201d, and \u201crig pigs\u201d.  Conservatives are people too and we need to persuade conservatives to vote for us next election. Insulting and name-calling unfortunately didn\u2019t get us anywhere. \n\nOnto my main point, I\u2019m getting really sick of activism culture taking over our institutions. It doesn\u2019t do anything besides make us millennials look even more whiny, entitled, and attention-seeking than we\u2019re already viewed as by the rest of society. \n\nI hate using the argument that \u201call Canadians are in the 1% of the world\u201d because relatively, us students are certainly not in the 1% of Canadian society. However, we have to acknowledge that as Canadians comparing ourselves to the rest of the world, we have the fewest barriers and oppressive forces preventing us from achieving success after graduation. \n\nMy grandparents were born in a country led by a dictatorship. There was secret police. There were political prisons. It was dangerous. Getting an education wasn\u2019t easy for them. They weren\u2019t wealthy and they\u2019ve been through way worse than the most of us ever will be. \n\nI really don\u2019t like what I\u2019m about to say, but I think it needs to be said. \n\nWe should stop complaining about our suffering and do something productive about it. \n\nI wanna be seen as the generation that fought through adversity with resourcefulness and work ethic. \n\nI don\u2019t wanna be seen as the generation that complained that \u201cthe game is rigged\u201d and only succeeded by changing the rules of the game. \n\nIn my life, I\u2019ve suffered from serious depression for years. Ever since I stopped blaming society for my problems, took responsibility for my own suffering, and put all my effort into being a confident and competent person, I have never been better. I like the feeling of accomplishment that comes with overcoming adversity. That\u2019s what\u2019s driven me from being a nihilistic and whiny degenerate to becoming confident and proud in who I am. \n\nSo these cuts will make education less attainable for millennials which is added to the list of unique millennial problems of:\n- hard to buy a house \n- high rent\n- boomers refusing to leave the workforce \n- excessive amounts of experience required for entry level positions\n- highest levels of anxiety and depression\n- more poor than other generations at the same age\n\nSo ya, we\u2019ve got problems that other generations haven\u2019t necessarily had to deal with, but I don\u2019t want to blame the world and complain until it gets easier. I wanna work harder than anyone and prove it to myself that I can succeed and overcome this adversity. I\u2019m tired of complaining and I think you should be too.","403":"Depression and budget cuts.

I\u2019m so incredibly appreciative of my professors this term. I had a major mental health crisis and all of them were so accommodating and caring. Without them, I would not have been able to carry on in my classes. Even when I was at least a month behind in all of them, not one wanted me or even suggested for me to withdraw, and instead took the time to help me catch up and made alternate plans for me to take midterms, do assignments, etc. that I had missed.

I know that this post may not get a lot of traction, but I've had the unshakeable urge to share this for a long time.\n\nMy first semester in first-year was piss-poor, to say the least. I haven't gotten all of my final grades yet for all of my courses (3\/4 of my grades are released, one still hasn't). But when I did the math for my grades; the highest GPA I'll probably get is 2.1, which is just..... most of you probably get the point. \n\nI felt miserable throughout my winter break and I hated my performance, a lot. There were days where I would ponder on the many simple mistakes that I could've fixed if I got my head straight in the middle of the semester. My negativity had gotten to a point where I contracted a fever and diarrhea for almost an entire week. I had to skip out on my family's Christmas party because I was too sick and bedridden to do anything, which just really, really sucks. Luckily, I'm much better now.\n\nNow, on to my story of transitioning from high school life to university.\n\nJust for context: I've struggled with a lot of behavioural and social issues and was diagnosed with mild autism at a very young age, which made me perceived to be \"different\" from other kids. I also had almost zero social skills and didn't have a huge network of friends because of that. Keep in mind that I took to heart most of these traits to heart, which made me an even worse person than what you imagine me to be.\n\nI've also had a string of bad habits from my high school (that up to now, still haunt me) such as: slacking off WAY too much in classes, being distracted too much and just overall, being a scatter-brained, procrastinating, lazy student who could still pass everything due to raw talent in the subjects.\n\nI remember a time period where while I was adapting from moving into Canada (specifically Edmonton) 3 years ago; I took a tour around the UofA when I was finishing high school. From there on, I just thought to myself, \"I wanna get in this school, and I'm going to get a high GPA.\" I've had dreams of me being able to live the ideal university life and perfectly balance my studies and extracurricular activities, like how most of us want our lives to be. \n\nKeep this in mind: I was a very naive boy who has zero ideas of what's it like smoothly transitioning from being a teenager to an adult as I was that kind of teen that never went out with friends, nor had a part-time job. I was practically a turd when it came to social interactions and teaching myself the \"soft\" skills needed to act like a functioning adult in the real world. **I was practically enclosed in this bubble where I thought to myself that I was \"different and special\" from other people.** At this point, most of you readers can already foresee as to how much of a trainwreck the rest of my story is going to be.\n\nEventually, that delusion of grandeur broke down when I first entered UofA. I was certainly surprised by how the class material flew by pretty fast and how most of the learning was mostly your responsibility at this point. This was certainly not an environment where my high school habits could carry me through. But still, I was very stubborn to think that my friendless, lazy-ass self could still hold himself together here in uni. Boy was I proven wrong by that.\n\nFor the next 3-4 months, life constantly gave me a hard slap to the face numerous times. I constantly got low marks after low marks in most of my quizzes and midterms. I did try my best to push my disappointment away, to the point where I kept telling myself that I would do better in the next quiz. \n\n**Spoiler: I. DIDN'T.**\n\nAt this point, this downward spiral that I'm currently in is going to get even deeper and deeper; up until I crash hard to the bottom. Unsurprisingly, I did crash, hard. After looking at how horribly bad my grades got towards the end of my finals, I knew to myself that this wasn't a fun joyride as I thought it would be. If anything, it felt like a nightmare that never ended.\n\nI've had an entire 2 weeks of winter break to ponder about the horrible mistakes that I've done and how my GPA could've been salvaged (and even saved) had I got my shit together at least midway through the semester.\n\nI had to see a psychiatrist as well to see what was just wrong with me. After the 30 minutes of interviewing me; he concluded that I didn't have autism at all and was wrongly diagnosed with it. However, he did also conclude that I suffered from mild depression and anxiety because of my experiences and personality overall. At the end of the day, I felt like a huge burden was lifted from me, now that I figured out what was really going wrong with me and how can I fix it.\n\nI've learned a lot of valuable lessons from my rough (even nightmarish) transition from high school to university life (and essentially: from puberty to adulthood). Here are some of the takeaways I've learned and what most of you guys should know as well.  \n\n\n* **University (and life in general)** is not just a test of pure and applied knowledge. But rather, it **is an endurance run**; a marathon to see on who gets the furthest and climb the uphill road. If you truly want to survive and even live in life, then show that you have the guts and means to do so. \n* **Make. Friends.** I'm pretty sure this has been said multiple times but for all of you loners and people who have suffered the same issues as me; please, do yourself a favour and establish your own network of friends. You'll make life a whole lot easier if you have an outlet for all your stresses and an emotional support network around you.\n* **Don't be stubborn**. Just, don't. Being stubborn to the wrong things will lead you to make mistake after mistake. Don't be afraid to ask for questions and\/or advice from others and be willing to listen.\n* **Learn from your mistakes**. I've made a lot of mistakes going through my first semester. The two most glaring and brutal being: not getting rid of my high school habits and trapping myself inside my own bubble. Be open to learning, change and self-improvement. Everyone isn't perfect so there's no use of having regrets either. Simply look at yourself, look at your flaws and\/or even the things you can't change about yourself, learn from them, and do your best to adapt from or move past them.\n* **Take care of yourself.** If I'm being realistic, I never took good care of my mental and emotional health throughout my first semester as I was constantly stressed, depressed. I was anything but happy or satisfied with myself. If you can, change up your lifestyle or daily routine if you think your problems lie there. Go visit a psychiatrist or therapist if you have to. Do whatever you can that makes you satisfied with your life. Just, be responsible.\n* **Don't. Procrastinate.** Believe me; as much as we can all be lazy at some point, this isn't certainly the right way to do it. Procrastinating will only lead to one problem piling over another until those issues make you crash into the ground. If you have the time to be productive such as studying or doing your homework in advance, please do it. It's going to save you a lot of time and avoid being stressed.\n* Above all: **Be responsible**. This about sums up all the other lessons I've already mentioned. I remember my dad always constantly telling me this one saying:  \n*\"Have fun at life. But, don't forget to be responsible for it.\"*  \nIt's only now that I'm starting to realize the true meaning of this saying. I think this saying in itself is self-explanatory, but I'll leave it up to you guys to ponder about it.\n\nI've made it a promise for my 2020 to never, ever, repeat the same mistakes I once did in my first semester. 2019 was a really rough year for me and I certainly hope that I can make a comeback from all of the troubles I caused for myself.\n\nThank you for listening to this TED talk and have a happy new year everyone.","510":"Happy new year everyone!. ","511":"Is there anyway to take a final early?. So I decided to stress myself out at the start of the year by going to beartracks and checking what my tentative final schedule is for winter 2020. It turns out that I have 4 finals within two days... what the fuck do I do? Can I beg the department to let me take one of them at a different time?","512":"Man I really miss university. The real world is not at all as interesting or fun as I thought it would be lol. I can't wait to come back to grad school after I get my P.Eng license. I miss seeing my friends and seeing all my professors. My job is nice but I miss being in class and seeing all my friends regularly.\n\nHappy new year everyone. Hope your winter semester goes well.","513":"Make yourself happy next sem!. This might be the procrastination, the new year new me bullshit, my alt rock playlist, and the after midnight existential crisis talking but honestly make this new semester about making yourself happy.  In no way am I saying screw school, but I'm saying do stuff you actually enjoy on the side.  If you want to do something, you'll find the time!  Honestly, what's the point of living the perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 life if you're actually miserable? \n\nWill probably delete when I wake up and my existential crisis disappears but for now enjoy my late night thoughts!","514":"Is there a grade-obsessed culture at r\/UAlberta--and is the spreadsheet contributing?. Many students and alumni report that GPA is an overrated and overemphasized component of their undergraduate degree. Nonetheless, many students feel considerable pressure to prioritize GPA over learning and passion-- and I have become increasingly concerned that the crowdsourced GPA spreadsheet is toxic and contributing to an already unhealthy, grade-obsessed environment at r\/UAlberta.\n\nThe initial motivation for the spreadsheet was a strong belief in transparency and that historical grade information should be available to students. However, when students say they are rearranging their schedules because of tiny GPA differences between sections, or get frustrated and angry because the spreadsheet said the class in 2013 had a slightly higher GPA than their class; I feel that having historical GPA information is actually increasing stress and anxiety amongst users. \n\nOverall, the spreadsheet is toxic because it does NOT encourage students to prioritize learning and follow their passions, but rather, it promotes a culture of risk aversion and grade obsession.**\n\nThe spreadsheet has had a worthy run and has over 1600 averages. This information will always be available and will never be deleted; this is crowdsourced, this is the subreddit's data. I'll continue it as long as its still desired, or pass it on to people with passion. But as we enter the new decade, I thought now is a good time to reflect on creating healthier conversations and a healthier culture around grading.\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n**In retrospect, I wish I had created a \"Course Experiences\" spreadsheet, where students could provide written comments about their learning experiences in different courses. I feel like this would have been more useful and less toxic for students than the GPA spreadsheet.","515":"what makes school EVEN more difficult?. 1) have PTSD due to a guy you dated for 11 months trying to kill you\n\n2) go to 4 years of therapy, meet your soulmate, get married, finally decide to finish your undergrad \n\n3) decide on a really tough final semester of your undergrad because you\u2019re excited to be challenged and also fulfilling requirements\n\n4) have said POS you dated for 11 months in 2014 stalk you and your new husband, resulting in a resurgence of PTSD symptoms every time an incident occurs \n\n5) have police and RCMP refuse to help you because you have no proof besides anonymous social media and email accounts harassing you and you can\u2019t get a clear picture of his plate when he\u2019s near your house\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got all those things checked, cry alone in your house for several hours and hyperventilate cause your husband isn\u2019t home, you got another harassing message this morning, and you have to leave the house to go grocery shopping and meet up with people but you\u2019re too scared to leave your home. But that\u2019s not the point of this, just an aside as to where my headspace is right now. \n\nMy PTSD makes me quiet, uncomfortable, and introverted at school, even though I KNOW I\u2019ve got to participate and talk to classmates\/profs for marks and generally to have a healthy uni experience. And I want to, I really do. But I start shaking, tearing up, and feeling panicky and trapped. Plus the whole scared of leaving the house. \n\nI\u2019m scared to post this, even under my fake reddit alias that he doesn\u2019t know, because dear god what if he finds this. \n\nHow do people with PTSD get along at uni when it\u2019s so crowded, loud, and over stimulating? Anyone else deal with it?","516":"parking on\/around campus? (park and ride). tl;dr: is there any hope for free parking? if not, what\u2019s the cheapest paid spot on campus\/near a southside LRT station? also, is a parking permit worth it and how difficult is it to get?\n\n\u2014\n\ni finally got my license and this will cut my 1.5 hour commute down by a lot. from searching this sub, it seems free parking does not exist - and if it does, people don\u2019t want to give up their spots which is fair. i initially thought about driving to century park and taking the LRT but apparently the spots fill up by 7am. is there any place on the south side (preferably free\/relatively inexpensive if paid) that\u2019s convenient? \n\ni don\u2019t feel confident enough to park anywhere that i know there\u2019s a chance of getting a ticket (random residential areas\/southgate mall) because that\u2019s too much anxiety for me as a new driver. \ud83d\ude05\n\nfor on campus, what\u2019s the cheapest spot that\u2019s reasonable enough in winter?

The thought is circling through my brain for what seems like most of the day. I\u2019ve been getting professional help for about 3 years. I started getting help after I attempted suicide in grade 12. I\u2019ve worked so hard to feel happy and although there has been periods where I felt amazing, it always goes full circle and brings me back to where I am today. I honestly want to be happy so bad and don\u2019t wanna take my own life, but I\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s never gonna happen. I\u2019ve frequently been visiting the high level bridge and pushing myself further to jumping. I\u2019m trying to be rational and consider everything before going ahead with this, but I don\u2019t have a lot of hope. It\u2019s my first year of business and I had high hopes for this year. The cohort year has been fun, but I still feel the same depression. Has anyone else gotten past depression and lived happily for several years? I need some hope, so if anyone is reading this please let me know if depression is honestly something I can beat because I\u2019m starting to feel like this isn\u2019t worth fighting for anymore. I wake up every day to go through the motions and experience very minimal satisfaction, so why continue? People say depression can be cured, but I think I might be hopeless. I don\u2019t know what else can be done, I\u2019ve received all the treatment. I\u2019m sorry I know that is a lot, but thanks for listening. I hope I can figure this out","524":"Starting over in the new sem. Last semester I found a good spot in my life where I had school under control and was social.

I'm in civil coop and have only had bad experiences with the engineering faculty regarding the coop program. I worked my first 2 terms at a job that was just recently re-approved to be allowed to post jobs after 7 years. I was not able to get a job for my WKEXP 903 term and got it waived last summer, and I was unable to get a job got my WKEXP 904 and 905 terms either, so I decided to take classes this semester. I've had it with the program, and my mental health has been gradually getting worse and worse the longer I stay in this discipline, anxiety levels at an all time high, battling with some pretty serious depression. My depression has gotten so bad to the point that I applied for AR and got approved and now get additional time to write exams. I've been trying my best to cope through regular exercise, eating healthy, and talking to a professional without getting medication, and would really like to continue the route without taking medication, but I've been finding myself waking up at all hours of the night due to anxiety attacks regarding the pressures of being in Co-op, and I found I've been required to exit lectures due to panic and anxiety attacks. I have talked to multiple coop coordinators regarding my mental health and how remaining in coop is NOT an option for me, and the most they did was offer me a card regarding off campus services that I can use, that I have been using regardless. Co-op is no longer for me, and I have realized the university would rather see students hospitalized before they will allow them to leave the coop program. Any advice regarding getting out of coop using my disability?","549":"Hey it\u2019s me back with another offensive question:).

Then I went to the (walk in clinic) and after expressing my concerns, she also basically brushed it off and gave me some 1800 number. Problem is, I need to see someone who can diagnose me so that I can get mental help and so I can get medicated. Because my parents don\u2019t agree with the existence of mental illnesses, I was never diagnosed as a kid, but in atriums high school and now in uni, I definitely became alarmed and after looking into it, I narrowed it down to either a) adhd\/add or b) sleep apnea. This is severely affecting my performance at school but my doctor is not taking it seriously!! What should I do? What did those of you who got a diagnosis as adults do?

As it's a cold Friday night and I have no girls over atm, I thought it might be good to address some of the recurring questions I have been getting these past few weeks. First, if you don't know who i am i would encourage you to brush up on your r\/uAlberta history. But let me address some of the points .. \n\nWhat was my initial purpose? When I first came on this sub I was a open ended \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ year student who basically had general questions and wanted to contribute to things I found interesting (I think polling was the thing i liked at the time - so long ago!). But then after I was getting more experiences from my time at uni I started to formulate myself and my own ideas. My concern about the War on Christmas was genuine, and I still believe it to this day. At first I just wanted to release my frustrations but then I noticed something very interesting and peculiar ....\n\nI noticed that while most people were outraged, a lot of people here secretly liked the post. Was it because they agreed with it? No. But rather the post, for some reason, alleviated stress and took people's minds of something that was concerning them in their lives (I posted during exam period). To my surprise, I got a few messages of not only support but thanks because I was indirectly helping people to cope during the stressful time of exam season. Surprised and honestly rejuvenated, this gave me a new purpose.\n\nAlthough I don't think I carried out my goal of helping people as effectively as I believe I am doing now. There were times that I regret. Have I been a dick on this sub at times? Yes, and I apologize for that. But in my view there were not that many instances of me being an asshole. However, one moment in particular I remember there was a new user who made a post saying something like \"What class should I take?\" and I inappropriately responded by saying \"You're not allowed to make that post on this sub, you should know better.\" I recognized it was wrong a few minutes after posting that and I was going to message the user and apologize but sadly they deleted their account. So if that individual has made a new account know that i am sorry. There was another dude who I had a back and forth with and i was a total dick to, cant remember what that was about. But otherwise I do think I was pretty respectful during that time and posted a lot of good faith posts, along with the occasional meme. \n\nIn my view I have been on the receiving end of abuse but we dont need to get to that. Just know that nothing people say to me phases me, especially on Reddit. But the idea of being a \"punching bag\" is something I wasn't too upset about, as I did want people to genuinely feel better especially during exam season. So I take no offense when people really downvote me as if it a way they can vent their frustrations, so be it. I think university is so unnecessarily stressful and overall it's a poor learning environment, so anything that I could do to relieve this stress was what I was aiming for. \n\nNow .. why have I changed? \n\nI've mostly changed because of factors outside of my span of control. So while I am continually posting my experiences and opinions, I dont personally go after people as much anymore because it isn't fulfilling and worth my time. This is why I dont post about politics anymore, as I just have no interest. But obviously if someone posts something controversial I am going to defend my positions. Just like if someone accuses me of something, I'm going to defend myself. I've grown up and just have different interests. It's funny as I look through my old posts and see how I have developed since then - and thank you for that. And no, I am not changing because I want to be a moderator. I dont care if i become a moderator or not, genuinely. \n\nAnyways, what is my purpose now? No idea, we'll see what happens. I think that's the entire point of growing up, to discover yourself through your experiences. Perhaps the idea that while I am Poly Sci, anyone can be Poly Sci? As my ideas and experiences can live on forever ..\n\nTo conclude I do mean what I say. If people want to talk, you're more than welcome to message me. So I hope that as this year progresses we can continue building positive connections with each other and our sub can continue to grow and develop as a supportive environment. \n\nYours truly, \n\nPoly Sci","559":"How furry pals at MacEwan University are reducing student stress | CBC News.

I was great. I still find it great. The thing is, I have two groups of friends that I'm really close with and before university, I would only ever see them separately as they were from different areas of my life but now that we are in university together, I see both groups of people at the same place at the same time.

I'm really the only thing they have in common so when I've tried that in the past, we always end up in awkward silence. \n\nMy issue is that I'm constantly having to chose one group over the other.

I was going to go to an advisor but I'm not sure if I need to make an appointment or not so I decided to make an account and ask on here instead lmao\n\nI'm a first year BEd student.

This year has been tough and it just got a whole lot worse.\n\nThe transition from high school to university was hard, the work ethic difference was huge and I was in no way ready for it. But something about it all has just just really put me in an all time low and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the cause, quite possibly is just everything being pushed onto me all at once. Let\u2019s start off with the feelings I have of being completely empty on the inside. I go day by day with nothing to look forward to really, and even when i do, they just seem like they are dull and boring. I go to school everyday, go to classes, interact with some people, go home, study, eat, sleep, and repeat. It\u2019s a continuous cycle that is dull and lacks any really excitement but is required. Now i understand that i could change things up a bit and hang out with some friends, but the problem is that they never want to hang out. All my friends prioritize everything else in there life and other people in their life more than me. For example, my best friend, every time i ask her to hang out, she always tells me that she wants to go home early, and on the days that she doesn\u2019t, she always reserve them for her boyfriend. She barely replies to my text cause she\u2019s always hanging out with her boyfriend and it gets kinda annoying. Every time she invites me to hang out with them, i always end up declining because I feel so unwelcome. Like the whole third wheeling feeling is horrible but when it\u2019s with them, it\u2019s on a whole other level, they are always secretive and laughing about things and never talk about things that allow me to join in on conversation. As for my other friends, they are always hanging out with their other friend groups and i never get invited, or they go to different schools and find it too bothersome to arrange time to meet up with me. I feel like everyone has their people and I\u2019m jut left in the shadows where i am left alone. On top of that, it always feels like a competition with all my friends, to see who can do the best. I understand that university is strongly built on being the best and getting the best results, but i feel so stupid compared to them, they all have 4.0 GPAs with minimal effort and dont even show up to class and I\u2019m stuck always sending them the annotated notes and still ending with a low GPA. For example, last semester was tough for me and i failed to do well in a lot of my classes, i changed my study habits this semester and I\u2019m doing better but they still make me feel like shit for it. Like the other day, I had gotten an exam mark back and did surprisingly well beyond my expectations, and of course my friend comes up to me and says \u201cwell you would be dumb not to do well, it was so easy.\u201d Mind you, he has a 4.0 and i guess just understands things a lot faster than everyone else; i dont want to say he\u2019s naturally smart but intelligence can be built onto with effort, but he\u2019s definitely one has had an easier i me understanding things quicker. He\u2019s always been kinda condescending, but deep down everything he says in regards to academics i feel like is true. My friends then continued to say that \u201coh you just got lucky\u201d or \u201chope you can do as well on the final since that\u2019s the important one,\u201d just because i scored higher than me. This all has caused such a strain on mental health and feel as if I\u2019m not smart enough for them or for this school. \n\nAlongside that, the relationship between my boyfriend and I are getting more and more distant as the days past which makes me feel like I\u2019m not enough. We are long distance and have been dating for over a year now. He got accepted to university of Toronto, and so he moved there. I\u2019m happy for him and I\u2019m happy that he loves his program and what he\u2019s doing, but is it selfish to wish for him to have stayed here instead. I know he was just looking out for himself and that i might just be something temporary in his life and so i dont want to hold him back. But the thing is, he\u2019s being more and more distant. He tells me he\u2019s busy and that he has other things to attend when in reality he\u2019s just hanging out with friends. I don\u2019t mind him hanging out friends at all, but i just dont understand why he won\u2019t tell me. He also happens to be hanging out around a lot of girls and it makes me insecure. I see their pictures and realize how much prettier they are then me, and that\u2019s when i start to overthink. I fee Iike I\u2019m not enough for him, that he\u2019s gonna move on and find someone better. He tells me not to worry, but my mind just wanders. He doesn\u2019t reply to me for hours and the whole thing just takes a toll on my life and therefore i spend time studying to try and distract myself from the idea of wondering what he\u2019s out doing. I mean, my boyfriend is definitely a good looking dude, even my friends say so themselves and he\u2019s social, so he would have no problem just meeting new people. So sometimes, i really do feel like I\u2019m just holding him back and that he cud do so much better in life. That\u2019s really the only benefit out of this whole thing i guess. It also doesn\u2019t help that i have trust issues since i got cheated on in my last relationship. My last boyfriend was sleeping with other girls while he was with me, in which i found out through a friend and one of the girls. That was devastating to me as he broke up with me before i found out and said that he couldn\u2019t be with me due to him just losing feelings and that I just wasn\u2019t what he wanted anymore.  \nThat made me completely insecure. My friends just add to the fire cause they always \u201ctease\u201d me about my looks and my weight. I have insecurities about my appearance and they know that, but they constantly bring it up to joke about, same with my weight. I am by no means overweight, but the jokes they make are so insensitive and make me feel like i need to eat less and constantly workout. I feel the need to cover up my insecurities with makeup and the need to allude nicer physical features to make up for the parts of me that are lacking. They say i have a good personality, yet they shit talk me to other people. They believe what others say when those people have never even met me. I feel Ike i can\u2019t trust any of my friends because none of them really care and they always spill my secrets to whoever and whenever even when i tell them to keep it, it\u2019s usually really personal matters that i dont want being spread around. Some of them only ever talk to me when they want to the gossip about my own life or other people. I have a hard time trusting people because i was continuously backstabbed in high school and lost so many friends because of it. Maybe I\u2019m just problematic \n\nI get zero support from my parents and they always complain about how I\u2019m always acting so stressed about school and that me crying over my friendships is stupid and dumb. They say i dont have any real friends or dont have any at all because of my shitty personality. That i bring so much problems into their life when in reality i am a really good kid. I listen to everything they tell me to do and don\u2019t get into trouble with the law or people in general. I dont go out very often and keep my health in check. I\u2019m good with my money and even make sure to help around the house. They make me feel so insignificant and feel as if my life is worthless. It\u2019s only whenever i have a mental breakdown that they show some empathy, but it all seems fake. \n\nLastly, i know this is stupid but the ting that really made me feel so insignificant and unimportant was my best friend forgetting that it was my birthday. Weeks passed my and she just never said it to me, she didn\u2019t even remember let alone ask to go out for food. I dont expect her to throw me party or anything, but even asking to go out for dinner would have been nice. As for all my other friends, none of them even remembered until they saw a post that one of my friends made in regards to wishing me a happy birthday. So all of them texted me late at night, I\u2019m not gonna assume tha it was because they saw the post, but their timing just made it seem like they all forgot. On top of that, my other best friends jus didn\u2019t even bother to ask me if i wanted to do something or my birthday. I know that people are busy but there as a break right around that time, and it\u2019s tradition that we go out and celebrate every time it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday. Maybe I\u2019m just not worthy of the tradition? I\u2019m always the one to plan all these things out, but for once i just wanted them to do it for me? Is that too much to ask?\n\nI don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m just being dramatic :\/","626":"I'm so tired of the \"getting to know people\" phase.

","653":"University's response e-mail regarding budget cuts.. The 2020 provincial budget just came out. Like every other post-secondary institution in our province, the budget impacts what will happen at our university.\u00a0 Especially involving things like academic programming, the people that deliver and support that programming, deferred maintenance on our campus, and your tuition and taxes.\u00a0\n\nLast fall, the 2019 budget greatly impacted post-secondary students,\u00a0including making universities (like ours) more reliant on tuition revenues, eliminating beneficial tax credits to students, scrapping the Summer Temporary Employment Program (STEP), reducing student aid funding, raising the interest rate on provincial student loans, and even more. This is what launched the Students Not Silent movement on our campus, which has now spread to campuses across Alberta.\n\nAnd, now,\u00a0budget 2020 has doubled down on placing that burden on students. Here\u2019s where things are at now:\n\nYour tuition is still going up.\n\nThe provincial government is trying to reduce how much they put into funding post-secondary education, which in turn is forcing institutions to try to find ways to make up those amounts. As per the provincial budget, they expect much of this to be done through increased tuition revenues; tuition is able to increase by an average of 7%\u00a0each year\u00a0over the next three years. Some programs will be seeing hikes of up to 10% in 2021 and 2022.\n\nWhat this means for you: Your education is about to get more expensive. For example, a student taking 10 classes next year could expect to pay at least $370 more in tuition, and $1,200 more by 2022. (Next year, Alberta tuition will be 375% higher than it was in 1990-91; that's five times the rate of inflation!)\n\n\nOn top of that, there is a lot of pressure on the university to fill seats, by whatever means.\n\nEven though we\u2019re already at record enrolment levels, the provincial budget is projecting tuition revenues to increase 6.9% in each of the next three years. That puts major stress on the university to fill seats, despite cuts to programs, more expensive tuition, job loss, and a low priority on addressing maintenance issues in student spaces.\u00a0\n\nWhat this means for you: Your class sizes will probably be larger. And, considering the university is likely to reduce courses being offered, it will probably be harder for you to get into classes or have options to fit into your schedule.\u00a0\n\n\nEven if the U of A performs well, there won\u2019t be any funding increases.\u00a0\n\nThe new\u00a0performance-based funding model\u2019s \"all stick, no carrot\" approachmeans there\u2019s nowhere to go but down: hidden cuts will drain university funding even beyond the\u00a0new 11% cut to operating funding.\n\nWhat this means for you: There\u2019s a really, really good chance that programs and courses are going to be facing further, deeper cuts.\n\n\nAnd, still:\n\nYour tuition and education tax credits aren\u2019t coming back, and can no longer be accrued.\u00a0(Note: you can still use \u2018em if you got \u2018em.) You and your family used to be eligible for tax credits of around $1000 per year of university. Those tax credits were eliminated on January 1st.\n\nYour Alberta student loans are going to be more expensive to pay back.Many of us probably got the email that interest on student rates are now higher. At this new rate, an average total loan amount of $30,000, over 10 years, will cost you about $1,800 extra over the course of your repayment.\u00a0\n\nStudent mental health funding is uncertain, at best.\u00a0The one-year renewal on mental health funding (shared with other institutions) is set to expire March 31, 2021, and we don\u2019t know if the U of A\u2019s chunk of that will be less than it has been before.\u00a0\n\nNo sustainable solution to address deferred maintenance.\u00a0The U of A needs around $150 million a year for building maintenance and repairs, yet only $35 million has been allocated. It would take much more than that to fix what needs to be fixed: in five years, the U of A\u2019s deferred maintenance liability will be almost $900 million.\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe U of A has difficult decisions to make.\u00a0We already have an idea of what those difficult decisions mean for students, but with the new performance-metric model to be implemented in less than a month, and the shocking 11% cut to the U of A\u2019s operating grant, you should be anticipating big changes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSeriously, the 11% cut to the U of A\u2019s operating grant is devastating. And disproportionately higher than the 6.3% cut at the University of Calgary.\u00a0Coupled with last fall\u2019s 6.9% cut, that means UAlberta is losing roughly $110 million within a few months. Hundreds of jobs are going to be lost. The Board of Governors thought they were being safe by planning for a 5% cut this year. They were wrong.\n\nThere are big increases coming to student tuition, fees, parking rates, residence rates, and meals plans. The hikes to parking rates, meal plans, and residence rents (at or below 5%) have already been decided. The Board of Governors will make decisions on tuition, fees, and residence rents (above 5%) on March 13:\n\nTuition:\u00a0Increasing by 7% for domestic students and 4% for continuing (non-cohorted) international students. Our advocacy efforts succeeded in directing 15% of that new tuition revenue for domestic students to needs-based student financial aid (about $1.83M), and limiting international tuition increases to 4%; they could have been much higher.\n\nParking rates:\u00a0Increasing 2% across the board, or between $1.79-$4.25 more per month, depending on location.\n\nMandatory Non-Instructional Fees:\u00a0Increasing by 2.67% overall (an extra $21.12\/year for a full-time student). This breaks down into a 10% increase for the Athletics and Recreation fee, a 0.94% increase for the Academic Support fee, and a 0% increase for the Health and Wellness fee.\n\nResidence rates:\u00a0Most residences are to increase their rates by 5% (an extra $37-$80 per month), while East Campus Village\u2019s transition from 11 to 8 month leases would increase rates by 10%, and, concluding renovations, Lister-Mackenzie residence would increase by 72% for single rooms and 116% for doubles ($493 more\/month for a 1-bedroom, and $524 more\/month for a 2-bedroom).\n\nMeal plans:\u00a02.9% increases across the board for Lister, Peter Lougheed, and Augustana (costing $130-$148 more per year).","654":"How hard is it to get a deferred final?. I always see posts about how people have had to go through hell and suffer through misery and trauma and still not get a deferred exam... \n\nBut in my experience, both of the finals I\u2019ve had deferred were relatively painless, easy, and quick. As long as you have a valid reason and documentation in order, it\u2019s pretty straightforward (at least in science).\n\nSo, I guess my question is, what are other people\u2019s experiences? I\u2019ve never had any issues, but I always see posts about having to go through hell to get a deferral, and failing courses because deferrals weren\u2019t granted.","655":"Mental Health Banquet. **Dress up and bring your friends!** There will be a Photo Booth, networking session, refreshments, and much more!

Let's all agree that switching our clocks twice a year is dumb. Especially tonight, when we lose an hour of sleep. So if we were to get rid of DST, would we want to switch to the winter time (ST) or the summer time (DST)? So, what are the pros and cons of each side?\n\n\nFor ST, we get more morning light, allowing for easier wake ups, and allowing our social clocks to match our biological\/solar clocks more closely and for more time of the year. However, as we just observed, we also get less light in the evenings. \n\n\nFor DST, we would get minimal light in the mornings from September to March, getting sunrises as late as 9:50am. Places like Grand Prairie would get sunrises as late as 10:20 am. I personally find this ridiculous. \n\n\nSo what evidence is there in support of either one? For ST, some people don't see much light at all for a little while since it's dark when they go to work, and dark when they leave work. These people usually like to think the extra hour of light in the evening is the best possible option. On the other hand, some people, such as myself, find it extremely difficult to wake up when it's dark outside, and extending this dark wakeup period for more months in the year sounds unbearable. Another set of people like having an extra hour to do activities in the light after work. I personally don't care about this during winter months, as most winter activities can be done in the dark, have flood lighting, or are done indoors.\n\n\nVarious journal articles and other studies have shown that dark mornings leave us feeling more lathargic, stressed, and can lead to more morning accidents and other increased health risks, one of which is SAD. One such study showed that while evening\/afternoon light therapy was still affective in combatting SAD, morning treatments were shown to be superior. On the other hand, for those that essentially experience no sunlight for that short period of time, it can also lead to significant increases of SAD symptoms. \n\n\nUltimately, I am in favour permanent ST. I think the pros of ST outweigh it's cons, and I would really hate it if it was still dark past 9am. I also find it much easier to wake up when it's light out. Wish me luck getting up on Monday!","660":"To the CEO of daylight savings. Fuck you","661":"Honest opinion on ualberta. How do you guys feel here?

I understand a lot of people are anxious and worried about the state of the world right now. I'm going to list all of the thoughts I've had that I've found reassuring in the hope that others are also reassured. \n\nOn School:\n1. Everybody is in the same boat for exams. We might have issues with cheating, but I believe they'll be few and far between. Everyone has to climb the same mountain so we're all still playing the same game, even if the circumstances are different. \n2. There's a good chance the undergrad office will have to accept a more generous curve given the online transition so our grades will probably be okay.\n3. We get to stay home for lectures, which for many people will reduce the stress of transit or any public anxiety from being in large lecture theatres. \n\nOn the Economy:\n1. The stock market is crashing, but the underlying economy is still sound. If you remove Coronavirus from the equation, the world gets back to normal capacity pretty quickly. Alberta's going to be hurting from oil prices but we'll survive as we always have until prices rise again. \n2. Multiple major federal governments from Canada and the US to the UK and South Korea are taking this environment seriously and they're trying to minimize the effect on workers. \n3. This economic environment will pass. You haven't lost any money unless you take it out of the market, so if you hold on, you'll see a V-shaped correction and you'll recover any lost money. \n4. If you're off work for now, just treat it like a temporary vacation. There's a good chance you'll be back to work in a couple of weeks, for no other reason than businesses can't afford to shut down for much longer, and the effect of doing so wouldn't be worth the trade-off. \n\nOn Life in General\n1. Most of this is media sensationalism. In reality, the mortality rate is likely much lower, with far more people having the virus without reporting symptoms. So we're not facing the end of days.\n2. Time heals all wounds. If nothing else, just wait it out, we\"l get through this in time. \n3. Humanity is the most exceptional species that ever existed on this planet. We've dealt with way worse than this Coronavirus before, and we're still going strong. We're all going to be fine. \n4. Time is passing much more slowly by perception due to the cessation of our busy lives and the constant media barrage of Coronavirus stories. It's only been a few days since everything got shut down, give it 2 weeks, and everything will likely have improved. \n5. Enjoy the extra time with your family. Play a game, read a book. Wait it out, everything will be fine. \n\nYou may be anxious and worried now, but wait it out and we'll all make it through. There is no need to panic, or hoard items, or start stockpiling water, or start worshiping Mayan gods. All of this will pass. In the meantime, just keep calm and carry on.","715":"Finally fully enrolled after 36 minutes of trying. Good god, this is the worst I can remember it being in all 5 years I've done this nonsense","716":"Might have lost a friend I made in class due to the cancellation of classes?. So I was friends with this dude in one of my classes and we basically talked every day. However, I never told him my name and he never told me his. I did see his name on his ID card before one of our midterms and it turns out he has an IG, but I feel like it's kinda weird if I add him since I never asked for his name and we never formally exchanged social media accounts. \n\nI've barely made that many friends since I've started university so I was hoping I could manage to keep at least one new friend this year.","717":"So this happened when prof says that the online classroom is not going to work =\/.

I read the course policy saying the weight of assignments could move to final exam with an excused absence.

A 50 minute lectures takes me &gt;2 hours to learn the material. 2\/5 of my professors just post their notes online and these aren't really intuitive classes. \n\nI really put my health through the gutter this last year. Last semester I ended with a 4.0 but at the cost of my mental health. Classes this semester were going well, even though I have more difficult classes this semester. \n\nBut if you looked at my quizzes and assignment grades, they've been dropping since the first week of march. I cannot focus or concentrate anymore. Corona virus spreading everywhere, being on complete lockdown, no friends to talk with, some family troubles that came up, etc.\n\nTons of assignments, demos, projects, and midterms are due in the next 2 weeks for me.

Countless other prestigious universities like MIT and Ivies have already made the switch ( https:\/\/www.thedp.com\/article\/2020\/03\/pass-fail-penn-mit-georgetown-smith ) because they realize the situation we have at hand is extraordinary. \n\nCheating is already rampant. How many of those computer science students were caught cheating on some sort of assessment last month? How far do you think people will be willing to go knowing that 50%+ of their mark is on the line. \n\nStudent mental health is definitely at an all time low. Given how far Covid has spread its inevitable that family members of people in our community are already being affected by it. Its not fair to us to expect us to perform while dealing with this. \n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? MIT implemented a PE grade, or Pass by emergency. That could work. But of course theres a lot of premeds\/prelaw\/pre-transfer students running around who may have been on track for a 4.0 that need these grades. So that PE grade should be opt-in. Or at least implement a system where our current grade in class is recorded so it can be communicated to other institutions later for transfer or post-graduate applications.","728":"Some mental health resources for those who are struggling.

And I know that it is difficult to come up with a solution in these hard times because not everyone is in a good situation and cheating is a big issue which causes a lot of problem for grading anyway.

I think a lot of these posts always say how the uni doesn\u2019t care for mental health and to some extent I totally agree but this is a situation when they\u2019re putting students mental health first and instead of appreciating that, you\u2019re fighting it.

It\u2019s been a long semester and we\u2019ve been working our asses off towards goals that many of us have dreamt about since we were children \n\nBUT that doesn\u2019t mean that we get to be cruel and quick with our judgement.

In the middle of this many have faced immense pressure to return home to their families. If you live at home I want you to think about this for a second: in the next five days you have to completely pack up your entire life, tie up all of your loose ends, find a place to live for when you return (maybe summer, maybe September, who knows at this point), oh and by the way classes are still happening so good luck catching up. \n\nI want you to consider the people who are under intense financial stress, because that majorly affects things. I know people who have lost coop jobs or other summer work placements they were depending on to pay for school. I know people who\u2019s parents have been laid off and are being asked to contribute financially. I know these are things that can be dealt with, but it is just more added stress in the middle of an already stressful experience (which definitely negatively affects academic performance) \n\nI want you to think of students who have kids, who are now scrambling to care for a child on top of going to school. I know people are saying you can work from home and take care of your kid and I don\u2019t know how much you know about toddlers, but I can tell you that a three year olds tantrum does not give a fuck that you\u2019re trying to write an online exam. \n\nI know that it\u2019s hard to accept that some people who haven\u2019t really worked that hard are going to slip through this semester, but don\u2019t you dare tell me that all of the people who will benefit from this didn\u2019t work hard. This virus has affected mass amounts of students in unimaginably stressful ways, and, if no measures are taken, will negatively impact academic achievement for people who aren\u2019t lucky enough to have the ideal situation. This isn\u2019t even taking into account the students who will get sick or have loved ones get sick. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best option, I\u2019m just saying that telling people they are a piece of shit who just wants to cheat on their finals is kinda not cool. \n\nLet\u2019s try and keep loving each other my dudes, even though the world is a lil scary rn. \n\n(Sorry what I\u2019m sure is an abundance of bad grammar, but quite frankly I don\u2019t give a fuck)","737":"This is ridiculous.

It seems like people are attacking each other right now when we should be supporting each other in this incredibly unique situation. So I need to voice an opinion. Obviously, it is about the proposal of the pass\/fail grading system.\n\nI think some people on both sides of this argument are being cruel and unfair to the other side and are failing to put themselves in the other side's shoes. For instance, calling anyone who supports a full change to a pass\/fail system a lazy underachiever who was probably going to get a low grade anyway is ridiculous. There are so many people so heavily affected by this switch to online that they can't hope to rely on their grade right now. Many people don't even live here and don't have a comfortable space or even a strong enough computer\/wifi to handle it. On that same note, some students have children or have been laid off from work and the stress of this situation is (understandably) far too much right now. I can understand that this pass\/fail switch is VERY beneficial to many students.\n\nOn the flip side, it is also unfair to be saying that anyone who wants to keep their grades is simply a \"pre-med\" who is putting their grades on a pedestal above other people's health. I do not think that is the case at all. I for one am not this fake title of \"pre-med\" and am quite distraught about the idea of a full switch to pass\/fail. Many students, like myself, were very much hoping for this semester to boost their GPA and worked extremely hard to pull it off. At some points in these past two semesters I felt I was shedding blood, sweat and tears to get the grades I wanted and I am very proud for what I achieved so far. Especially in the face of my own demons I was fighting in my own head. Taking that away makes me, and probably many other students, feel like all that work they've done was for nothing. It's more than just frustrating, but is contributing to just another kick in the gut while I've been down.\n\nIt's also unfair to be degrading the employees of the university for any choices they're making right now. How can this possibly be easy for them? They are trying to navigate an extremely delicate situation, and many of them once again are likely stuck at home trying to take care of their families while they try and come up with a plan to please everyone (literally thousands of students and employees). Give them a chance. Not to mention this hasn't even gone through yet, they may very well still be considering their options. \n\nIn the end I do believe the OPTIONAL pass\/fail system is the best route to take here because I think it accommodates the most students at one time. Some I've seen argue that it creates bias. However, those same people contradict themselves when they say, \"don't worry about our GPA for grad programs and such because they'll make exceptions for the CR.\" It's contradictory because they won't look at the grades and the CRs and say, \"this person was the better student because they took the grade,\" because they will recognize the fact that while this student (who took the grades) likely had the means to go about completing the school year during the shift to online, this student (who took the CR) may have been heavily effected by the switch. In other words, make an exception for students who take the CR. Hell, they'll even consider that maybe you got sick in this time and literally couldn't leave your place of residence. So regardless of what you take they are going to see both sides when making decisions.\n\nRegardless of your opinion of what I'm saying here, stop attacking others on this sub. Everyone is having a hard time right now. Hard is an understatement. We all so often complain about the lack of mental health services at this school and this is not helping. We should be helping each other up. Seeing both sides and understanding that some people are struggling immensely. Care for one another. Find the best course of action by working together and stop this bullshit feud dividing students. We're not \"pre-meds\" and \"underachievers,\" we're students trying to navigate history in the making. \n\nTL;DR: Full shift to pass\/fail = unfair; Only allowing letter grades = unfair; Optional = fair; support one another","745":"Basic Grammar smh.

A lot of people are complaining that mandatory CR\/NCR will ruin their grad school admissions. Then what about people who are affected the most by these circumstances? Now they have a CR on their transcript while the majority of other people have their actual letter grades. They are effectively screwed over for grad school admissions and don't tell me that its about preserving the majority of students. That's not the kind of society Canada is, minority matters. They are perceived as having a choice to choose CR or letter grade when in reality they don't have a choice. Choose CR and screw over your chances of grad school or employment or letter grade and keep studying for your future? Even if I had Covid19 right now I would choose to keep studying because my grades matter just like it is for all of you and choosing CR\/NCR in a optional scheme is a death sentence for people who are sick. \n\nBesides, most schools will effectively ignore anyone's GPA during this semester due to many reasons discussed previously on other threads. The inflation of grades due to significant number of students no longer trying and people cheating. So what if students at UoT has a letter grade while you have a CR? Can UoT guarantee that student with a letter grade didn't cheat or that the letter grade is not due to the fact that their peers are no longer trying? There's a good chance the committee in every school in Canada will just swipe clean this semester and ignore it in their GPA calculation. They cannot have 100% guarantee its the students actual representation of their abilities. Let's say they do intend to count the letter grades. You don't think there's a significant number of people FROM OTHER SCHOOLS WHO ARE PISSED that they either still proceed with letter grade or that its optional CR\/NCR? A lot of people are being screwed over right now because they are balancing between their physical + mental health and their grades. Other schools are essentially saying too bad so sad, keep studying. I am hopeful that the committee at every school will not be heartless and will just ignore EVERYONE's grades for this semester.","747":"Happy International Day of Happiness!. JK, fuck everything.

[https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sybildenise\/posts\/10220210491079796?notif\\_id=1584729199116609&amp;notif\\_t=feedback\\_reaction\\_generic](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sybildenise\/posts\/10220210491079796?notif_id=1584729199116609&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic)\n\nOriginal post linked above\n\nBelow is my open letter regarding the impact of the university's recent CR\/NCR decision. I hope you will read it and understand the implications for students like myself.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nMy name is Sybil and I am a fourth-year student at the University of Alberta in the Faculty of Arts, studying Political Science. I am deeply upset and frustrated by the university\u2019s response to COVID-19, by changing the grading system. I have heard much confusion and debate around this choice, but here I am going to lay out my argument as to why this is absolutely the wrong choice.\n\nFirst of all, this diminishes many students at the University of Alberta\u2019s hard work. This disproportionately affects exemplar students and benefits the lower-achieving students. I will get into the personal details of my situation later in this letter, but as a principle, this is punishing hard-working students. Many of whom are dealing with the emotional, psychological and economic fallout from this virus. This is not just an option that harms the \u201cbarely impacted\u201d, as there are students in this category who have an array of different supports available to them. For a student who has committed hours and hours every day studying, is it fair to have the same grade on a transcript as a student who simply did not show up or complete the work to the same extent? Many students in the A-range put in countless hours to achieve these grades and should not have them wiped from their transcript. An A+ and a D should not have the same value on a transcript. We worked for these grades and we deserve them. This is not a zero-sum game, students require these boosts they have worked hard for and it is unfair to take this away from them.\n\nSecond, when the university decided to move to remote delivery, we were already \u00be of the way through the semester. Most of my classes simply had three weeks of lectures, and due to higher levels being once a week this was 3 sessions in total for me. In many of my original syllabus, one of the classes was scheduled to be review. My professors adapted quickly to the changes and set up virtual classrooms with technology, many offering to directly speak on google hangouts with us over any concerns to substitute office hours. Was this ideal? Certainly not. But, a big part of academic careers is adapting to what life throws at you, and still pushing forward when you can which many students have done despite their circumstances. Not only is the semester almost done, but the majority of grade components for many of my classes have also been completed. In Arts, many courses are split into smaller sections, with components such as term papers, midterms and assignments. Some of my courses have 75-80% of the course content completed and are just awaiting 25-20% weighted finals that I have already began reviewing for. Two of my courses have bigger components such as 45% of the grade still in standing, however, approximately 20% of this is weighted for finals, 25% for term papers. These term papers were started over a month ago and have already had hours and hours of research and writing poured into them. Essentially, many Arts students have already completed a large percentage of what is required by their courses.\n\nThis brings me to the debate around exams. Many students in support of this policy have argued that there is no fair way to administer exams. As someone who is not in sciences, I understand that for other faculties this may be a much harder situation to consider, however for Arts many courses are absolutely capable of doing so. I had courses this semester that made minor changes to administer exams, such as an oral final being scheduled over google hangout, or written finals being converted to take-home finals. Take-home finals essentially involve being assigned long or short answer questions in a time period, such as one week. Students then complete this and hand it in by the due date. I have done several exams this way throughout my university career with no issues, as they were originally planned that way in the syllabus of the respective course. To say that adjusting exams is impossible is simply a lazy choice from the university.\n\nAnother argument occurring around this choice is how this will impact students applying to post-grad. If you have always had good grades, you are fine, this will not bring down your GPA. However, for students who did not excel in their first year or two this is detrimental. If you worked hard all semester to have that wiped, graduate programs have no choice but to look at your other grades. Sure, there can be written letters reflecting performance, but if they\u2019re looking at the last 2 years they simply will not care. There is an oversaturation of candidates with high grades, they could only consider 4.0 students and fill their programs, there is no need for them to look at a 3.4 student whose last semester would\u2019ve saved them but got a full semester of CR. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that other big Canadian universities have committed to more equitable solutions in the face of course cancellations. The University of Alberta is disadvantaging their students.\n\nNow I want to speak about why this has affected me personally. In the first years of my university career, I had severe mental health issues and other life events and did not do well in school. In fact, as many people in my life may know I completely withdrew from my program for a semester due to my mental state. I was also asked to enter the fresh start program or be required to withdraw from the university. My GPA was 1.2. After healing from life events, seeking professional mental health support, and completing the fresh start program my GPA began the upswing. This took a lot of work and was not immediate. I sacrificed work hours, personal hours, and many other things to ensure my grades would reflect my capabilities and get me into a post-graduate program. Last semester I had a 3.5 GPA. This semester I was seated for a 3.7-4.0 depending on finals. I set my sights on Law, and have already taken my LSAT. Some law schools look at your GPA from the last 2-years for the application instead of your cumulative GPA. This was obviously the choice I required. I have one last semester in the fall to complete before I have met my degree requirements. To be competitive in my L2 GPA I absolutely needed to reap the benefits of my hard-working semester. Due to the drastic difference in my marks before my last 60-credits begun, I have no chance of getting in with those grades. To have my potential at law school which I have worked tirelessly for the last year and a half taken from me is devastating. I will either simply not get in, or have to take another semester of full courses to boost my GPA, risking burn out and unsure how I will pay for it. I know I am not the only student in this position. I am urging the University of Alberta to reconsider its decision and understand the serious professional, emotional, financial and psychological implications of this. You have a duty to your students to honour the integrity of their work and degree.","754":"Is there even a point to studying for exams?. I have an exam on Monday and feel seriously demotivated. I highly doubt our profs are going to write all 150 of us golden reference letters.

Can\u2019t they just give us a CR now so we don\u2019t have to continue on with this stress? l o l","756":"Let\u2019s look at the big picture here.. Yes. It sucks that you put a lot of effort in this semester to boost your GPA, and it sucks that that effort will be going unnoticed. It sucks and you are more than entitled to be upset. Take your time to be pissed off and when you\u2019re ready, keep reading.\n\nNow we have acknowledged that this is a shitty situation. Right now everyone around the world is in a shitty situation and is upset because of things being cancelled, losing their job, being inconvenienced, and having things around them change.\n\nThis is probably the first time in my life I have seen that everyone in the world is in the same boat. We are all scared, anxious, and unprepared. This is a GLOBAL pandemic.\n\nThis is not about you and your grades, this is about doing the right thing and that\u2019s what the university is trying to do. \n\nAt the end of the day. Your GPA is not gonna get worse, and realistically unless you got all A\u2019s this semester and you don\u2019t usually, it\u2019s not going to get better.\n\nI think people are really missing the big picture here. This is an incredibly unique situation, and the university has made a decision that they believe will be best for the most number of students. \n\nBe a little bit more compassionate to the people who are not going to do well this semester because of this situation.\n\nI do believe that pass\/fail should be optional, but it\u2019s less fair to have people\u2019s GPA go down because of an event they had literally no control over than have everyone\u2019s GPA\u2019s completely unaffected because of this pandemic.\n\nIn short, your grades are not more important than a global pandemic and it\u2019s time to get perspective on what\u2019s happening here. This is a time for the community to come together, not turn against each other because of something so trivial. Please be kind to each other, it\u2019s a hard time for everyone right now.","757":"All I wanna do is cry honestly.

Just talk to us and keep us in the loop.. Interact with your STUDENTS AND STAFF. Set up an inbox for suggestion about how to move forward. For example, ask us if we would be interested in online therapy sessions set by the university. We are the ones affected primarily by grades and these changes. Not the administration nor the university, US. Ask us what would be beneficial for us going forward. Form a poll with a variety of options. Have us vote. Send one final email about the results. Obviously, there will be discontent from people who didn\u2019t have their option chosen. It\u2019ll be what the majority of students wanted which is in no way fair to the minority but these decisions will never be fair. Yet, they have two valuable points. Discussion and Transparency. We get what the fuck is going on. \n\nFor example, if we\u2019d been in the loop about the transition to remote instruction, we could\u2019ve asked what would happen to labs and exams before a final decision was made.\n\nI\u2019m just tired of the wishy washy decisions. If the majority feel mandatory CR\/NCR is appropriate, the discussion can be over because the majority of students wanted it and we all were in the loop. \n\nBut when we\u2019re forced to accept things without any consideration for alternative options, that\u2019s when students feel angry. \n\nDon\u2019t send a million emails. Don\u2019t make us wait for them all night. Don\u2019t make us stressed out. Don\u2019t tell us you care about our mental health and your staff when you throw things at us and force us to accommodate. Don\u2019t change your policies the next day. Don\u2019t tell your instructors to change their entire teaching style and assessments again and again. Don\u2019t tell people in residence to move out four days before and stress out our international students.

I'd just like to point out that for many of us, this is proportionately not that bad of a situation where our grades are going to slip at all because it doesnt affect us. Obviously there are going to be people it impacts very greatly, but I know every single person has had a semester in the past that they had someone very close to them die in the middle of midterms or finals, or faced being evicted, or was going through some form of abuse, mental health issues or trauma and weren't given this pass\/fail option. I personally know someone who's parents both died from sudden cancer in one semester.  It's obviously too late to help us now, but it would be nice if UofA gave students the UofT option of having pass\/fail for 4 courses in their academic career. Maybe all universities should do this if our mental health is truly a priority and people wouldn't be so up in arms about losing out on a semester when they're trying to make up for a semester where they faced trauma.","762":"yes we get we're not getting grades and we should all get over it \ud83d\udc4d. we will get over it dont worry there's literally no other choice i just need to say my last thoughts and then i'll go study for my unworthy finals as i've already passed my courses but i paid for this education and i'm not letting it go to waste\n\nits okay for ppl who arent or dont mind losing anything to remind us that we're heartless because we only care about our grades and not the pandemic but like what do you want us to do? go out and help ppl? a lot of us are locked inside our houses there's nothing to do at least we still had online classes and studying for finals to keep ourselves busy but this news is disheartening and a lot of ppl are losing their motivation to study and feeling more stressed\n\npls for the love of god understand that for some ppl losing possibly good grades you personally have no idea what they've been through for is causing more stress and anxiety right now than anything else but we're selfish because we're overreacting and our mental health doesnt matter so thats great \n\ni'm just so baffled why so many ppl think its so wrong for everyone to want to benefit in this mess of a situation not just those who were already not doing well this semester or cant do well anymore because of the online format or health issues\n\nimagine if letter grades were mandatory would no one be complaining then? would ppl be still preaching about how grades dont matter and there are bigger things in life to worry about? except literally no one is asking for mandatory letter grades\n\nso many ppl are telling others that they dont have to worry because the uni will consider and maybe some exception can be applied to them because they are in engineering\/applying for grad or med or law school\/fresh start\/worrying about graduation requirements or academic standing etc\n\nif all these ppl end up getting some advantage over the others how fair do you think that is then? with this option of a written letter about the grade one could have gotten along with their CR some ppl still have better chances than others with just a CR\n\nif you think that grad schools\/employers will understand why we have 5 CR's on our transcript then whats stopping them from understanding why someone may have chosen to get a CR and not a grade in the middle of a pandemic where in such little time we were forced to adapt to an online format that just doesnt work for everyone\/every course or having to care for your own health or a loved one's","763":"In response to people talking about grades:. it\u2019s not just universities in Canada but many universities in the US and all over the world are following the C\/NC system.

So yes, your hard work WILL BE SHOWN maybe not on transcript but YOU WILL BE REWARDED. \n\nWhen thinking about students who had to return because their country closed down borders and their residence closed down- the uncertainty and anxiety they are having to face or someone whose Mother is fighting the virus, I think people like us who are living with parents and being able to sit inside and study with disruptions should be a bit more considerate.","764":"Can people stop virtue signalling and being hypocritical by having zero empathy themselves towards the other side..

Plus, there are so many flaws for academic integrity that need to be addressed so 40,000 students don't cheat on finals! And if the university cares so much about my health and well-being, why do they expect me to keep stressing over school while I am stuck inside my house with no direct outside contact for the foreseeable future. Do they not see how bad that can be for someone's mental health?!? There are people leaving the city, the province, or even the country right now to get home before things start getting worse, but that final exam in a couple of weeks still matters for some reason.

I hope all of you are doing well in this turbulent times.\n\n***Warning*** this is going to be a long post. \n\nFirstly I want to make it clear that my post is not about if the initial desicion made by the uni is right or wrong, this has already been addressed quite a few times in different posts with everyone having their own argument to it, what I want to address is the appeal to push to revoke the desicion for a mandatory CR\/NCR.\n\n\n I get that all of your are quite frustrated and I have read all the posts related to this matter. I know it's especially hard on the people who were expecting to raise their grades this semester or were looking to this semester's grade to get into a program, however you have to understand that at this point in time it's not possible anymore.\n\nMost, if not all professors have changed their syllabus accordingly and students have already started going forward with this new syllabus. If they were to reverse the change, not only would this portray the university in a bad light, it would also hamper a lot of students. This would end up causing a lot more stress and anxiety, not to mention confusion among the student population. I think that's the last thing we want right now.\n\n I also think a lot of you are forgetting that our Professors are humans too, they have their own family, health, etc that they are worried about. Putting forward this change will not only give more stress to them as they would have to restructure the course again, but also would now have to make a scale where there would be NCR\/CR students and a scale with students with grades and a GPA. This will not only cause a lot of stress to them but would also break the universities entire system on how GPA for every student is accounted for compared to all other students. \n\nThe university has already taken measures for every scenario with the change to CR\/NCR, instead of trying to change this back. Let's as a community try to find our way through this. If you have a certain scenario that your worried about, such as grad school, academic qualification etc talk to your advisor or email your dean. The university is there to help you, they are not your enemy. Let's all stay strong as we find our way through this crisis and not cause anymore confusion\n\nEveryone stay indoors and stay safe.","802":"tfw its been &gt;2 weeks since you talked with anyone and your dad gets laid off and its 3am and you're still studying and you havent been sleeping.

The U of A is the only U15 University in Canada that implemented a mandatory CR\/ NCR. What people don't understand is how this policy took place. \n\nThe General Faculty Council is composed of 150 plus members. The GFC Executive is limited to 20 to 30 people. \n\nThe GFC Executive made this decision without consulting with the whole council. Even if they have the power to do that, it shows the lack of democratic and sound decision making protocol this university has. \n\nThis university is a shit show. Mental health means nothing to the higher ups. Science dean keeps on using \"promoting students health at this time\" when every student at the U of A is obviously 100000x as stressed as any other university. \n\nIt dosen't matter about NCR \/ CR whatever. It matters when in times like these, our university reveals themselves and shows us who they really are. \n\nBtw, CCS is now closed. They said university health centers and stuff will remain open. They are now limiting to one session over the phone. \n\nThe average student has no idea how policies are made, how decisions are taken.  U of A's decision making protocol has been the worst in the country. \n\nThat's why we are the only university to ADOPT a pass \/ fail system blanket approach. \n\nU of Toronto, U of Calgary, McGill, University of Manitoba, Queen's University are all giving students the option.\n\nIt's not even about credit no credit.

As of right now, I don\u2019t have a solid opinion either way on the topic because there is a lot of grey areas, and while I feel like both sides have great points, there\u2019s just a ton of variables that I feel are constantly being overlooked in the arguments. I am beyond thankful to be a part of the essential maintenance of our course at the moment, and while I understand that the longer we delay opening golf, the greater the risk of me losing my job is, but I also understand the severity of the situation we are all faced with as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the big things that inspired me to compile this information was that I felt everyone was lumping together golfers are entitled assholes, and everyone who opposed it as liberal doomers. And I just want to encourage everyone to move beyond that sort of thinking and move the topic back to a discussion instead of an argument.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know if this post will be received well, but I feel like I spent all day hearing one side of the argument from the industry, and then all night hearing both sides from other parts of the community. It\u2019s weird, but I just want to reach out to help people better understand some of the things that people just aren\u2019t always aware of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I\u2019ve stated previously, my opinion right now is that absolutely we are capable and up for the challenge of opening the courses in a safe way. It is absolutely doable, but there are other variables that do diminish this confidence. Golf can very easily be opened in a safe way that follows (even surpasses) the current guidelines from AHS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor clarity, some of these modifications include increasing distance between tee times, pay and book online, no carts, no clubhouse, no food and beverage, raised cups, etc. All of these things are great ideas, and absolutely executable from our end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConcerns can be raised though. There are many people currently still hosting parties at their houses, so can we trust golfers to follow these rules as well? Do we need to threaten to revoke memberships with no refunds if people are caught not following the rules? (I work at a private club, so I can\u2019t speak for how this would work at a public course). I read one comment from someone that I laughed at that said something along the lines of  \u201cwe cant even get these people to fix their divots, why should we assume they\u2019ll follow any regulations we put out for this.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if someone were to catch the virus at the course? Would it be worth the negative PR that may come up? Can we even consider opening the washrooms? This is the single most important touch-point that I can think of when it comes to us opening, and despite all of the measures we can take, it is still a huge risk factor This one is a huge point for me, I just can\u2019t seem to form a solid opinion on it. We would spend a lot of money retro fitting these areas to be as safe as possible, but can we trust people will use the facilities appropriately?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue that is more of a personal opinion from me is golfing with people outside of your household. This is a huge varying opinion, and I\u2019m just stating what mine currently is, and it\u2019s that we should only be meeting up with people from our households. But that\u2019s not who people want to golf with. A while back I read a comment (in short) that mentioned that if you were close enough to smell someone smoking, then you\u2019re too close. I get it, this can be up for debate, it\u2019s just my personal opinion on the matter as of right now. I think as of right now, I would encourage two-somes from the same household, and then re-asses and loosen this as time passes. If people are opposed to going out as only singles or only with people from their household, then doesn\u2019t that defeat the argument that it\u2019s for exercise and that its actually for social time with your friends. I get it, I miss my friends too, we all do, it\u2019s just another facet to consider, and I understand this still helps with mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue that I have brought up previously in my comments is staffing. We employ about 140 people seasonally. Currently we have about 20. Okay, we can slim the admin down to just have the accountant and general manager, maybe one guy in the pro shop, and then essential grounds staff\u2026 now we\u2019re down to around 10, minus the admin and the mechanics, were down to 8. There are 8 of us taking care of 300+ acres of land right now. (I\u2019m not going to get into it right now, but I\u2019ve made previous comments on what those 8 people sort of do that\u2019s essential and other details if anyone feels like looking into my history) to get to course to a playable level, we will need to bring in at least 20 to 30 people, all of whom at the end of the day, are non essential. These are kids and retirees. I don\u2019t mean ill words on any of the kids that I work with, but we can barely get these kids to show up to work on time and showered, let alone washing their hands every 20 minutes and following proper protocol. I also love these kids and these older guys who mow the fairways, I don\u2019t want any of them to get sick. I use the term kids loosely, there about 18 to 23 years old. But it doesn\u2019t\u2019 change how difficult it can be to enforce these measures even with them, let alone also with members. But at the end of the day, I think we wouldn\u2019t bring on our older staff, and would probably focus more on the younger staff. It\u2019s just too risky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn that, some people could say that we have a full world of available labour right now, so lets just hire people who are easier to manage. But that\u2019s not how a good company operates. We will hire these kids back first because they do a good job, and we take care of our staff. Period. We will always offer the work to them first, despite any arguments that we could just pay anyone right now.  But at the end of the day, that\u2019s a lot of non essential staff, making minimum wage, to be bringing on, let alone further discussions on communal mowers, tools, lunchrooms, etc. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe communal areas is a big one. Everyone would have to eat outside in the parking lot or something, which sort of sucks, but its doable. We would definitely remove access to the fridges and microwaves and things like that. Again, sucks, but doable.  Communal tools is a big factor. We use many, many, many pieces of equipment daily. We would need to disinfect each thing after every use, and also trust that everyone was disinfecting properly. We would have to organize all of our staff in a way that we no longer have morning meetings; logistically challenging, but again, doable. We would have to ensure every staff member had a their own walkie talkie, so that would fall under price increases. I\u2019m just trying to stress that theres a lot of these little things that I think people don\u2019t think about. We also would need to order or lease many more golf carts, as staff could no longer ride together to their tasks throughout the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is another area of cost. We pay people more, price of golf goes up. We have to disinfect everything every 20 min, price goes up for costs and labour.  Currently we are going above and beyond at our work for measures like this (something I\u2019m very proud of our management for tbh), and it is expensive and time consuming for 8 people, so the cost will just increase as you bring more staff on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am all for getting outside, getting some fresh air, and how much support we all need for our mental and physical health right now. I am a little tired of the \u201cdog parks are open\u201d argument. I don\u2019t have a dog, I have no idea how important or not important it is to take your dog to a park instead of for a walk around the block, but it seems to get brought up every single time this issue comes up more so as a combative fallacy than an actual argument at this point. But again, I don\u2019t have a dog, I don\u2019t go to even Nose Hill right now because its busier than I\u2019m comfortable with. But I like playing tennis, so why can\u2019t I play tennis with someone I live with (I live alone, so sucks for me and bad example haha). But you get the picture. It opens up a world of other discussions, which can be good and bad (maybe ultimate Frisbee, I\u2019m not sure what other sports to include here tbh). But the thing is, maybe we all just need to be happy going for a walk for a little bit, because there\u2019s no reason golf is more important than tennis or any of the other activities right now. Once we start having that conversation, then aren\u2019t we just having a conversation about easing up on restrictions in multiple areas? Which we will absolutely will be doing anyways in the coming weeks as soon as the time is safe.  I strongly believe that when the time in the next few weeks comes to ease up on restrictions that golf will absolutely be one of the first things to open, I have zero doubts about that. We as a golf course are prepared, ready, and up for the challenge of keeping all of our members and staff safe. The guidelines to make golf a distance sport are achievable, but it is also non-essential at the end of the day. I want to go play tennis, but I know it\u2019s just better right now if I go for a walk around my community until we can have a little more stability with everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want all the golfers out there to know that we are absolutely working hard to ensure that as soon as that green light comes, we will be ready to open for you, but it needs to be safe to do so, not just for you, or us as staff, but our community as whole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions, I really want you to ask them. Or if you have any points from either side that you feel I have missed, I would love to expand on them from my perspective as someone who does this daily. I feel like theres a lot of misinformation being thrown around, and I just want everyone to be informed on both sides\u2026 and to be nice to each other in the comments section haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Something that I forgot to mention as far as budgeting. We get the majority of our revenues from events and tournaments, all of which are basically cancelled for the season. We would be opening solely under the revenues from membership dues. There will be no income from weddings, tournaments, pro shop, food and beverage, cart priveledges, club storage, etc. I don't do the books for our course, so I can't speak to how this impacts a lot of things specifically, but I do know that it is the majority of our revenue, more than all of those other losses combined. Which also makes me stress that I can't speak for what that looks like for public golf courses where they may recieve most of their revenues from public tee time bookings.","841":"Vent. Please remove if not allowed, I just felt like I need to vent.  I don't mean to bring anyone down.\n\nI have been depressed since I was 14 and my anxiety got really bad at around 16, however, I never thought about hurting myself.  It's more of a numbing defeating feeling.  From age 14 to age 19, I was just unhappy.  I was never satisfied not because I thought nothing was enough but because I felt empty.  I was always in search of something new like new people just to feel excitement or something.  It's like an addiction, always looking for my next fix.  Something new, someone new.  My second year in university was great, I felt fulfilled and confident.  \n\nRoll around third year, and I got hit hard.  I feel very empty, I just rather sleep.  I do everything professionals say to do, I take my anti-depressants, exercise, eat healthy, spend time with family and friends (I reach out when I need help), take on hobbies.  I still feel empty, nothing makes me happy.  This year I was involved in a lot of extracurriculars and improved my GPA dramatically, but still no happiness.  It feels like I'm outside of my body, watching myself do that stuff.  If I accomplish something, it feels like I'm watching someone accomplish it not me.  Experiences just seem faded and second person to me.  \n\nI'm tired of feeling like this.  I do my best to feel better but I can't.  I'm scared that I'll always feel this empty because every time I get better I crash harder right after.\n\nSorry for bringing the mood down, but I'm exhausted.","842":"Are professor's able to catch cheating in eClass?. Quick context, this is for my friend who cheated on their final by using a separate laptop for answers.

But I am in total disbelief at the difficulty of that final.\n\nIn no way shape or form was that an accurate representation of our knowledge, the final was not weighted well at all across our term work and the time that was allocated was honestly abhorrent for the difficulty of those questions.

As you may know, Trudeau has just announced the Canada Emergency Student Benefit that will give students $1250 a month from May to August. One eligibility requirement is that you must make under $1000 if you\u2019re working and so I have to ask, why?\n\nIf a student was making X amount a month and has their wage decreased by Y percent, it\u2019s affecting them no matter what. Their cost of living is tied to how much they were making, there\u2019s no way they could\u2019ve accounted for a pandemic. So the idea that students aren\u2019t affected by decreased wages if they\u2019re making under $1000 is ludicrous. \n\n$1000 is a very restrictive amount too. In Alberta, not accounting for taxes, thats 67 hours of work a month or ~17 hours a week. What about essential workers who work more than 17 hours a week but not full time. They\u2019re working harder than before because of panic buying, sanitizing things etc. They\u2019re at a huge risk to get it and they KNOW that. The mental stress of working in something like retail right now is really high but if you work 17 hours a week you get nothing. It incentivises going to your ESSENTIAL service job less so that you have enough to live on. \n\nThink about it, you make $900 a month and get the benefit getting you to $2150 but if you make $1100 you get no benefit and get $1100. making $200 should not make the difference of meeting requirements and getting help. Id say both the person making $1100 and the person making $900 are both in need of help but only one will get it and that isnt right.\n\nNow what about me? I used to work 100 hours a week at minimum wage at a gas station but hours were cut and now i work 74 hours. Ive lost a huge amount of my wage i needed to live on but i still make too much to get help but i still really need the benefit. I could ask to work less but I dont want to inconvenience my boss  and make him go in because he has a newborn and his father living with him and hes a really good guy. I talked to him about it and he says he more than understands my predicament and can cut a shift a week to get me below the $1000 threshold if I need him to. However, a coworker is leaving in may and he has to hire someone so he warned me \u201cim more than happy to help you but remember that when i hire someone i cant hire them under the pretense of getting 3 shifts a week and then just take one away and give it back to you when this is all over\u201d and i can understand that to be honest. So basically, i take the financial security right now and risk it in the future or fuck myself over right now. That is a failing of the CESB in my opinion.\n\nSo what do I think should be done? Im the one complaining so I should have a solution. \nMake it universal to students.\n\nIts already less than the CERB.\nThe government profits off of us as it is through interest on student loans.\nEVERYONE is struggling right now.\nA wage reduction is a wage reduction no matter the beginning amount.\n\nWill some students possibly make like $3000 a month with no income cap? Probably. But its a price im willing to pay to make sure people (including myself) dont fall through the cracks.\n\nThe CESB should\u2019ve been universal from its inception and included international students.\n\nWhat a joke.","866":"Guilty about taking advantage of the pandemic.

I didn't even tell him. I kind of thought I wasn't supposed to. I thought I could just deal with it myself and I tried to act normal under a lot of mental stress but it would get very hard after a while and I couldn't take it and I'd do things I'd later regret. Like the double personality would kick in if I was even a little bit stressed or fearful, so that although I had the same memories, it would feel like someone else's memories and not like I was the one had lived through them, so I'd go from being really caring one moment to being cold and unfeeling the next time. Looking back I can see it must feel horrible to be treated that way by someone you really care about, and I hate that I put him through that. \nWhy didn't I just say these things in the first place, so that he knew I was struggling and that it wasn't because of him. Why wasn't I more truthful.

Hi everyone,  \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the way we relate and interact with each other as university students. While important, the social distancing measures, along with the numerous changes to the way we live and work, have the potential to harmfully impact mental health. I know on a personal level, I have at times struggled with my mental health since the pandemic has started, and I also know that I am not alone in feeling this way (which is normal, and ok)! \n\nIn light of these uncertain times, our students need access to the appropriate mental health professionals and evidence based treatment more than ever. The Graduate Psychology Association is throwing a fundraiser to raise funds for ACCESS Open Minds, a resource here at our university that connects struggling students with the appropriate mental health supports. Additionally, on a national scale, ACCESS aims to improve the research on and accessibility of mental health support to Canadian youth ages 11-25. We will be selling hoodies and sweatshirts with a student\/psychology-related theme to raise funds. You can find more information at: \n\n[www.studentsstilltogether.com](https:\/\/www.studentsstilltogether.com) \n\nWe will aim to ensure that a large portion of the funds will be allocated to the ACCESS team at University of Alberta in order to directly improve our student mental health services and accessibility. \n\nPlease feel share to share this fundraiser with others and spread the word!","911":"Mental Health Project Recuiting.

Hello all: I am currently taking 5 summer courses (engineering) and I thought some of you would like to know the effect of having letter graded online classes. \n\nThe entire semester has been a train wreck. \n\n1. All exams are open book, which may sound like a good thing until you realize time constraints still exist and are actually tighter than normal to compensate. For submitting exams there are two possibilities:\n\nA) For many courses, all written work must be submitted (via .pdf) within time limits, so if your computer, your email, scanner or phone don\u2019t work instantly you are outta luck and have to had your potential cheating recorded. \n\nB) The other option is actually worse. Some professors bypass the submission of written work entirely and condense 15 mark application questions into two or three written responses that are automarked. So if you truncated data a couple of times and are outside the 0.5% threshold at the start, you get 0 for a question worth 25% of the exam. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even to mention the absolutely flagrant cheating that is occurring in many classes. Not every class is supposed to have an average in the 80s in Engg.\n\n2. If you are like me and don\u2019t have tons of friends you know beforehand in your classes, good luck doing assignments in any collaborative fashion. Meeting people in classes is basically impossible because all classes are zoom based meaning all chat has to go through the central forum and can be viewed by the prof and every other student, making personal or specific conversations impossible even at breaks or when given time to solve in class problems. \n\n3. The privilege of having global chat at all can be rescinded at any time when one student in the class decides it\u2019s funny to change their name on Zoom and sexually harass the prof.\n\n4. Help on assignments and seminars is such a mixed bag and sucks for both profs and students. Some profs are somehow expected to take huge numbers of hours to respond to student inquiries, which are drastically up since peer to peer collaboration has decreased. Also have any of you actually tried to proof an assignment question over video chat? It\u2019s a complete nightmare for the prof and wastes dozens of hours of their time, hours which probably don\u2019t get compensated. Other profs have clearly used this pandemic as an excuse to be even more inaccessible. Asking questions after class is often impossible and if you can\u2019t make their office hours, good luck.\n\n5. Assignment renders: this deserves its own point. When you are inevitably rushing to upload an assignment or exam .pdf often the document doesn\u2019t render properly. Because the deadline has passed, TAs usually can\u2019t ask for resubmissions for marking purposes, regardless of how completely illegible the work is if the assignment didn\u2019t render properly or your TapScanner wasn\u2019t lit properly. I\u2019m not a TA but I\u2019ve already had assignments that looking back I would have gotten annoyed with as a marker.\n\n6. Lecture timing: An incredibly under-appreciated part of uni is that between classes is that you walk from class to class. Or in other words. You get to take 10 mins between each class and get physical exercise for every hour of content. As there is no distance to walk between your computer and itself, profs can get away with teaching the entire 60 or 90 minute block. This may not seem like a big deal but it means with my schedule that occasionally, I sit at my desk without getting up for 6 or more hours straight.\n\n7. Textbooks: the Bookstore has done an excellent job ensuring textbooks are shipped out on time but the current COVID pandemic has massively overloaded the standard mailing system to the point where you can\u2019t buy books in store and mailing takes up to two weeks. I didn\u2019t have multiple required textbooks until the end of May after ordering them week 1.\n\n8. All of this implies you get a professor that is relatively organized and can at least lecture competently. If you get a prof who would be disorganized in a normal semester, you get a complete nightmare. I\u2019m currently on the brink of withdrawing from a non-core Engineering class because the professor is so disorganized the class lacks the basic resources to actually solve the assignments. I can\u2019t get the textbook due to sellouts and even if I did it won\u2019t get here until Finals. Assignment feedback and solutions are just not posted for review. In class handouts are just not being given or substituted. \n\n9. The mental toll on students: This pandemic has been hell for everyone. People have lost ungodly sums of income, students who rely on living outside of their parents homes for a productive work environment have been forced to move back home, the hobbies we use to destress are often gone or restricted, letting steam off on the weekends just doesn\u2019t happen. Students often go weeks without leaving the house save for a walk around the block, a brief respite from a world now dominated by endless homework, Netflix and porn.\n\nI say all this not to pointlessly yell into the reddit abyss about my very minor problems in the context of a global pandemic. I say this because those of you going for online classes this Fall need to know what you are in for, what it\u2019s like to have 3.5 months of classes and graded exams in the midst of all this chaos. \n\nTons of people are working hard with the resources they have to make our education experience as tolerable as possible but the fundamental constraints online classes impose has caused a substantial reduction in the quality of the overall education experience. If you are debating taking classes this Fall or taking a gap year, this is what you are comparing a gap year to.

For years I have been lurking amongst the UAlberta student population, slowly building resources to dispense in a time of need. The increasingly grim circumstances befalling the student body have caused me to act.\n\nI have held a near monopoly for years on a certain subset of black market, a black market selling dark, rich, sweet, gold. This gold has slowly infiltrated the entire university, the precise instructions for its creation and distribution scrawled on Psych 104 flashcards, written in the back of Accounting 301 textbooks and even included as a hidden outro on one of Roger Moore's PHYS 130 videos. Cooked up in home labs surrounding Edmonton, nothing satisfies me more than when I see an innocuous tablet of black gold consumed on campus, only creating demand for another.\n\nAs lectures continue to be online, my empire is collapsing. Decreased student to student contact is causing my network of distributors to become isolated, unable to recruit willing and oblivious students to partake, to share in the joy and beauty of this luscious high.\n\nMoreover, depression is skyrocketing. It was a feeling I knew all too well, until the black gold vanquished all that is evil in my life.\n\nAs an act of public charity, I have decided to end my profiteering over this enterprise and release the black gold unrestrained to the masses. I will post further instructions here at approximately 9pm EST. \n\nIf you feel possessed to show gratitude please email  [premier@gov.ab.ca](mailto:premier@gov.ab.ca) and kindly tell him to stop ruining this wonderful institution as without this income stream, tuition may be a struggle this fall.\n\nPeace,\n\nArchlitdawn","950":"The semester is about to end but so am I.

I am going into my 4th year and so far, university has been nothing as I expected. I hardly made friends that lasted longer than an academic term, never been to a party, and have no fond memories unlike high school. All I have done is commute in packed LRTs and buses and studied when I got home. When I see everyone posting about how much they dread not having a social life it makes me question where I went wrong.\n\nA lot of the points brought up about online classes being terrible have some simple answers. $500 zoom meetings? You are paying for a degree, not just the course. Household is distracting? Go somewhere else, as you would anyway but with a mask. Course delivery will be bad? I only ever hear people trashing professors for being inaudible or having a thick accent, or not putting slides on eClass etc etc. It's not as if in-person delivery was any better. You were still falling asleep in class or even skipping them altogether. Right, there are valid points but these do not warrant the extreme conclusions of skipping a year in my opinion.\n\nYeah the virus situation is shit, but at the end of the day I get to study in my own little room without having to go outside. Outside where the skin hurts my face in the winter and where I feel self conscious in the summer. For the past few months my anxiety has been at an all time low.

After help from family, I started to get better.\n\nHowever, for the past week or so my anxiety and stress are flaring.  I'm exhausted.  I just wannbe in bed.

Some background, I am a University of Alberta graduate (Engineering 2016) and was recently accepted into the Faculty of Education near the beginning of August. I had a very difficult time in 2018-2019 pursuing a Master of Science, transitioning to a Master of Engineering due to issues with my supervisor, and then ultimately withdrawing from it entirely in April 2019. I ended up getting two F's in the semester as I couldn't even think about finishing those courses (after I withdrew) without starting to dry heave and kicking me into panic attacks.  \n\nThe University of Alberta doesn't deserve its reputation and my experience with it has been so negative recently. I thought I'd be moving away from talking to robot humans after leaving the Faculty of Engineering, but it seems it's just an issue with the entire University as a whole. I wouldn't recommend pursuing post-secondary education with the U of A anymore after this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to start this off: I've been working at getting into the Faculty of Education ever since a completely shit experience with my Masters in Engineering. My mental health had deteriorated significantly as a result of my supervisor and his completely abnormal expectations for me in comparison to literally any other grad student alive in the building. It was about putting in 110% of the work without allowing for any time of destressing. I was questioned for taking one hour out of the week to go to the gym as I shouldn\u2019t have time for that since they did not have time for that. I ended up withdrawing from the entire Masters program a week after the deadline had passed but at that point, my mind was so uncertain about dropping it entirely as it meant dropping engineering entirely as I had no recent work or academic experiences. This resulted in me getting two Fs for the remainder of the courses and led to me trying to get a backdated withdrawal as I had been in a rough spot at the time.  \n\nIt took forever to get through the administration that my shit mental health was largely due to my experience here. More examples were given and I even had paper evidence corroborating my timeline of my mental health taking a dump. Being told \"comparing yourself to others is not valid when talking about mental health\" was fucking insane as I was telling them to their face that I was forced into a terrible place. But \"oh you can't say you were more stressed just because you were doing more work than any of your classmates!\"\n\nWhatever though. I was able to get a backdated withdrawal in the end, but it took from January until May to even get that done. I had been pushing to get this done much earlier as I knew that Education would be going through enrollment soon, and that meant I needed to look for electives and enroll in them quickly. However, whenever I didn't email them, NOTHING would be done. They told me that everyone was on board with the grade change, but nothing was done for 40 days until I asked for another update as some time had passed (gave them the benefit as I had been hassling them for a while too but it turns out I should've kept hassling them). I inquired with the Faculty of Education about my application as I was afraid electives would end up being full, and I was told to wait as the next round of enrollment applications would be looked at some time in June\/July. I inquired again in July and was told it would be very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was finally accepted early August 5, just before the weekend. I couldn\u2019t enroll in any courses nor build a schedule preemptively, so I was forced to wait past that weekend. I looked through all the available courses and tried to draw up a schedule in preparation anyways. Out of all the required courses, one gave me the option to choose an elective. I became interested in taking an Intro to Counselling course (EDPY 442), but it requires that I take one of my already-required courses as a prerequisite (EDPY 304). This meant I'd have to take it in the Winter semester, but the course was already full. I ended up asking the instructor if an exception could be made for one more spot, but it turns out that he couldn't do that. However, he placed me on a waitlist for the course and said I'm currently first in line. This means all I have to do is hope a seat opens up, or else I'd just have to take another course as an elective! But it turns out that there were zero courses with an open seat left in the semester. So, I was fucked! My only option left would be to inquire about taking the course (along with its prerequisite course) in the Fall semester simultaneously as corequisites. I contacted the instructor of the course, and they end up getting department permission to allow this to go through!!!!\n\nThis is great news!!! So, I now move a course from Fall to Winter in order to free up a space in my schedule so that I don't exceed the five-course limit. Everything is a go today, and my courses end up being moved so now everything\u2019s fine! I've got the permission of the instructor, Dr. Mrazik, and now I have an open slot to take the course! I don\u2019t want to include the screenshots of my email communications, but they include remarks that I would take as condescending in tone among all the other communications I've got from them. I\u2019m sure this kind of experience can be corroborated by many people who have ever tried to transfer into, or enrol into classes in Education.\n\nSome examples of the communications I got when asking about whether I could be stuffed into a full class or take classes as a corequisite instead.\n\n\"If the course is listed as full, then there are no seats remaining.\"\n\n\"If it is listed as a prerequisite, then it cannot be a corequisite. If it could be, it would be listed as such.\"\n\nAll very NO SHIT SHERLOCK type of responses.\n\nAnyways, today I send out an email to EdPy after contacting the instructor at 12:59 pm asking to be enrolled in the Lecture and Seminar section of the course (and seats were all still open at this time\u2026 I checked. They\u2019ve been open for the last three weeks).\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/7gffqsQ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/7gffqsQ) \n\nThey ask for my student ID number (in an already-existing email chain) which they had no issue with when I asked them to enroll in the Winter instead of Fall for the course I needed moved. But now I suddenly need it to enroll in this course!\n\nAs I am talking to them at this point, she proceeds to fill up the course's remaining seats to let me know that the course is full, and the instructors are not allowed to waive prerequisite requirements for courses. This is after I replied (after the 1:32pm email) and told them the instructor specifically told me it was completely fine to take EDPY 304 and EDPY 442 simultaneously, and she would have no problem with me lacking the entire course as a prerequisite anyways.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/lS4JtFC](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lS4JtFC) \n\nHowever, I think prerequisites are in place for the benefit of the instructor so that students don't go into courses unprepared. But if the instructors are willing to waive it, does it hold as much significance as a requirement? Anyways. So now the course has been filled up (even though its been open for three weeks yahooooo!!) and as soon as I inquire about it, they decide to fill the rest of it up. Yay me!!!! I was also in contact with the instructor this whole time and asked for assistance in enrolling into the course as I had thought everything was pretty much set.\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/JIugkkQ](https:\/\/imgur.com\/JIugkkQ) \n\nThey (the enrollment coordinator person) don't end up replying to me at all. Now, turns out the department decided to scold the instructor for doing this. And I was just on a goose chase the whole time! \n\n [https:\/\/imgur.com\/HBknmyg](https:\/\/imgur.com\/HBknmyg) \n\nLuckily, a conference seminar opened up in the winter semester that I can enroll for again, but I need to move the course back from Winter to Fall in order to do it \ud83d\ude42 And the course that needs to move has its first class on Tuesday afternoon as well (FUCKING TOMORROW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all so that I can enroll in an elective I'm interested in \u2013 one that had an open slot in the Fall but ended up being filled because they want to spite me? Maybe not, but it sure feels that way. Maybe if I knew if the other two students that were given the OK were enrolled. Being told to fuck off (politely) when expressing my reasoning for my interest in taking the course + why it will make better my experience as an educator..... lol. \n\nSo, unless I can foster some incredible relationships with instructors here, I'll never return to the University of Alberta for a MEd or anything after this. The University of Alberta doesn't deserve its reputation, and I don't think I'd ever recommend it to anyone who has the ability to go to any other post-secondary institution. I don't think administration gives students any benefit and they are extremely unsympathetic towards any issues you might experience. \"Rules are rules and if you want to make an exception, you can fuck right off.\"\n\nAlso, the \"first on the wait-list\" thing is probably a joke too since apparently instructors don\u2019t have any ability to influence enrollment. (Anyone able to have an instructor help them enroll before? Let me know. Specific examples in the Faculty of Education would be super cool.) My remaining option is just to get enrolled in an elective in the winter semester and hope I can enroll into EDPY 442 anyways. It\u2019s not the end of the world by any means and my health has gotten significantly better since quitting Engineering. I just wanted to share my completely anxiety inducing experience with the University. I contemplated about posting this as it will probably ensure I just don\u2019t ever get enrolled in the course after this, but I\u2019m tired of the University telling students to get bent and us just having to deal with it. I can\u2019t imagine members of the Faculty of Education turning down eager students wanting to become good educators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah we are now 9 hours away from the first class of the semester, and my schedule is still in limbo because the enrollment coordinator has been making it extremely difficult for me. The instructors who are passionate in making sure their students are prepared for the future are not on the same wavelength as the University itself. And this is evident through my experience with TWO faculties at the University. There's a ton of emails and posts about nurturing your mental health and taking steps to better yourself, but the University has yet to show me that they have implemented that into their procedures. The people working in these mental health groups are great, but the University isn\u2019t even working at reducing the number of people who are stressed enough to require help even when they come asking for it.  \n\n\nMaybe the grass just looks greener on the other side and other institutions have just about the same kind of admin, but this has been my experience with UAlberta :)","995":"can u imagine still talking lol.

Facing rejection during sorority recruitment damaged my self-esteem and confidence. During recruitment, potential new members have conversations with active members, and then active members will assign them points based on whether or not they \u2018fit\u2019 in to pick and choose which girls are \u2018worthy\u2019 of joining. Then the girls are ranked on lists, and the top girls get a bid. A few of my sorority\u2019s membership selection policies were racist, classist, and sexist, which led me to disaffiliate after discovering them.\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of joining a Panhellenic sorority:\n\nPros:\n\n* I enjoyed most of the events! It was a great way to meet people in other sororities and fraternities.\n* Most of the girls I met during my time in a sorority were really nice!\n\nCons:\n\n* My first (and only) year ended up costing $1451! This is $225 MORE than they advertised during recruitment! Joining a sorority is a huge financial burden!\n* Along with dues, there is the financial burden of buying new clothes for meetings, a dress for formal, and gifts for big-little reveal. \n* You can get fined a lot of money for not going to certain events. A lot of the time, work, school, and mental health issues are not valid excuses.\n* Even if we did not live in the house, we had to do chores or else we would be fined.\n* You can get fined for wearing the wrong clothes to meetings.\n* There was a points system, in which we would receive points for going to events. We had to EARN the right to attend our social events (such as formal) by accumulating enough points. To me, this didn\u2019t make sense because we PAY for formal through our expensive dues!\n* My sorority was very controlling. They could force you to delete certain posts from social media, ban you from drinking before and after sorority events, and alcohol was banned from the house. \n* The leadership positions created a hierarchy, which created a toxic environment, as you were expected to be friends with the same girls who PUNISH you with fines.\n* Some girls in my sorority were very catty and rude when talking about other sororities, namely local sororities.\n* The pledging and initiation events were very culty and uncomfortable.\n\nI also want to acknowledge that there are a lot of problems with fraternities such as hazing and sexual assault. I wasn\u2019t involved with fraternities during my time in a sorority, so I cannot speak on these issues. \n\nEven though all events will be virtual, new members will still be required to pay a lot of money. To me, joining a sorority was not worth it when events were in-person, so I can imagine the same will be true virtually. Honestly, I am ashamed and embarrassed that I joined a sorority. There are more meaningful and less expensive ways to make friends in university!","1008":"Any advice from second year or finished engineering students?.

Religion can give people structure and purpose to their lives, but is a religion required for this?\n\n- \"All Pastors are Bastards\" - In the same vein as people who say there are no good cops because they support a system that tolerates and hides the bad ones, do good and virtuous religious leaders bear responsibility for holding up the institution of religion, a system that covers up child abuse, endorses and enforces sexism, and denies equal human rights to LGBT+ people?\n\n- Is religion required for some people to have a sense of morality?

I have done nothing at all","1053":"So you want to apply to the University of Alberta?. Oh yea baby, it's October, you know what that means? Admissions open!\n\nHere's a quick guide for ya (not official just based on my experience on applying twice):\n\n**GENERAL TIPS**: Apply early, apply early, apply early. If you know what you want to do, don't wait! Do it now! I can not stress this enough!!! DO IT NOW! Also, don't put all you eggs into one basket, apply else where too and into different programs that interest you. This increases your chances of getting an offer to a program that interests you, even if it isn't the institution you were planning on going to. You never know what changes in the future.\n\n**How to apply?** UAlberta Launchpad is the place to apply. It used to be ApplyAlberta, however, based on my experience, you will still need a Launchpad account. Didn't get a log in? Contact student connect. The launchpad has everything you need for admission (e.g. transcript dates, admission decisions etc.) Also check your ualberta email from time to time, some important things might slip in there as well. \n\n**What average do I need to get in?** In previous years, you were able to find a rough average for competitive programs. This is no longer a thing, no one really knows what average you need. Regardless, these averages fluctuated per year and were never set in stone. Just know, competitive programs (like eng, nursing, science) *usually* were in the high 80s-90s. Even with these marks, it doesn't guarantee you entrance. Even if you don't get in right away, you might still get an offer later, don't stress about it. Since you applied with your grade 11 marks, they will reevaluate you again with your grade 12 marks. \n\n**Transcripts?** If I recall correctly, there was an option for the UofA to request your Alberta High School transcripts on your behalf. Make sure you check this option or else you will be responsible for your transcripts. Missing transcripts = denied admission. Always triple check launchpad for these deadline dates, if you are worried about something you see on there, email student connect *early* so that they can get it sorted out. IB\/AP\/Other transcripts? You are responsible for them, as in you have to request for them to be sent to the UofA. I am not familiar with AP, but for IB you are able to send it for free one time through your IB coordinator. Talk to your IB coordinator (probably later in the year) to get this sorted out. \n\n**How long does it take to get a decision?** This has no answer. I know people who got a decision within 48 hours, others where it took months. At this time of year, know lots of people are applying at the same time, they are working through it. In my position, when I applied out of high school I got a decision in 3 days (excluding the weekend) and when I applied again as a uni student it took 4 months. If you are worried something is taking longer then it should, contact student connect, but keep in mind COVID has slowed everything down. Wait times are up in the air, no one knows. \n\n**First choice...second choice?** The program you really want to get into first = first choice. Program that is your \"backup\" is your second. They will evaluate you in this order. \n\n**My average is too low?** You will be reevaluated again throughout the year, don't stress. You can get an admission offer all the way until the end of August. \n\n**I don't know what to do!** Visit the (virtual) open house. This is great, talk to people in the program you like. Even if you don't know what general area you want to go into, take a look into everything that even peaks a slight interest. The UofA has a multitude of programs, check them all out. In the end, if you aren't sure what you want to do, you can apply undeclared as well.\n\n**Should I take a year off?** I cannot answer this for you, it is your decision based on your life circumstances and your goals for the future. Do what feels right to *you*, not your friends or family or society's expectations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INTERNAL TRANSFERS**\n\nSo you are currently at the UofA and want to go to a different program? The application process is basically the same! Be aware that competitive averages still apply. Also, admission decisions take **forever**. Apply early. Concerning transcripts: I had an issue with one of my transcripts and nearly gave myself a heart attack trying to sort it out. Watch launchpad like a hawk, and make sure transcripts you sent are received (make sure it says so on launchpad). If student connect is taking too long and its urgent, try connecting the faculty you are applying into. Sometimes, previous years transcripts are stored, but double check this!\n\n**Takeaways**: Admission season is super stressful, but from the bottom of my heart I wish you all well in whatever you want to get into. In the end, if things don't work out the way you planned, there is always another option for you, don't give up. Heck, you might get into the program you have dreamed of getting into but might end up switching to something else. It is normal to feel lost and uncertain as you are taking a huge step in your education, but things will work out in the end. Work hard and try your best, there is nothing but success in your future :)","1054":"How many hours or days do you guys spend studying for mid-terms? and am i normal?. i'm just trying to get a feel for if im going way too overboard bc i literally studied so hard for one mid-term, like 12 hours everyday for 7 days. i did study pretty regularly before that too though for the second half on  the month.

I have study groups but the people in them tend to only text in class but nothing else.  Add into the mix my preexisting mental health problems and the shorter days and you got yourself seasonal depression and anxiety.  Also I can't sleep at night because my head feels like it's gonna explode from overthinking: so I'm always tired and I sleep way too much.  Last year I had a few friends that I could talk too but they were toxic however at least they listened and ranting in itself can be therapeutic.  I talk to a professional and have meds, but it still feels too much.","1070":"Adderall for classes. Hey guys! I hope this isn't too taboo but I was wondering for those of you who take adderall how did you get a prescription? I never really struggled with getting good grades in high school, but all throughout university I've really struggled to focus and study. I'm in my fourth year now and really trying hard to get into a master's program and honestly I'm just having a horrible time staying focused and making sure I keep up with everything. \n\n One of my friends gave me one of their adderall pills (I know, big no no) but immediately I was able to sit down and study for 8+ hours and got everything done I'd been dreading in one day. It gave me a huge boost of confidence and honestly I'd never been able to focus like that before in university without a ton of distractions. I've never been diagnosed before with ADHD or anything but it seriously was such a huge difference. I know I tend to hyperfocus on things I really enjoy (I ride horses and tend to completely zone out when I'm riding) but just can't motivate myself easily to do things I don't enjoy without a lot of distractions and taking way longer than it should. I don't know if that would indicate to a doctor though that I have symptoms of ADHD or ADD but would a doctor prescribe Adderall or something similar without a hard diagnosis? What was your experience? \n\nHonestly I'll do anything I can to get into this master's and it seems so many of my friends have such a competitive edge when they take it! I want to do this the right way though and seek out healthy options of how to speak to a doctor about this, what my options are, and the process to getting help. Thanks so much for any insight!","1071":"Guys Im struggling.

I'm writing this to ask all of you a question: how has your experience with online learning been and are you all having a hard time like I am, are you failing your midterms too? Is what I'm experiencing normal? Personally, my mental health has taken a big hit from all of this and I'm not sure whether I should sacrifice that for marks. I think it's sad that this is the case.  I understand that we have to work hard and uni isn't easy. But does it have to be at the cost of an individual's mental health? Tons of uni students commit suicide everyday. Is that really the normal?\n\nHere's my experience with uni so far:\n\nI'm sure you all have experienced the tough transition from in person to online learning. I don't know about the rest of you, but my experiences this year have been terrible and mentally  exhausting. Its kind of gotten to the point where I've become numb to failing whether its on a midterm, quiz, or showing up for the synchronous lectures. I'm a first year, so the transition from high school to uni combined with online learning has made things even harder than they normally should be.\n\nBut in reality, these are things I'd like to blame for my lack of success in some of my courses. But honestly, I don't even know if maybe I'm just not as good enough as everyone else at uni. I never was a straight A student until late high school anyway. \n\nI like to think that all of this is much more stressful and mentally demanding because of the addition of covid on top of the stress of uni itself. However, I'm not so sure since I haven't had a uni experience without covid yet.\n\n Mental health is a topic that I feel is not being acknowledged enough especially for a group like us who are studying post-secondary online, and I believe having a conversation about that can and will be relieving for many students like me who realize they're not the online who are going through this tough reality. So please, I'd like to hear your perspective and your experiences about all of this.","1073":"Does anyone like online classes?. So I\u2019m seeing a lot of posts talking about how atrocious and hard online learning and school is but am I the only person who genuinely prefers it? Adhd ruins my time management so I\u2019m late pretty often and GAD a lot of the time makes it so even if I\u2019m only 10 min to class, I have to pick between legitimate anxiety attack or no class that day. That being said I heavily relied on either my friends in class helping me with notes, hoping the professor would be a little gracious at my difficulties, and cramming from the text book. This also just made it really hard to even wanna go to class or try to stay caught up on lectures, and I\u2019ve been in the habit of learning whole classes from the text book in a week; in lesser words, I was scraping by the skin of my teeth and always extremely anxious and on edge because of my own faults. \nThis semester though? Online has made it so that not only can I sit at home and do all my work without ever being anxious about missing stuff and timing, but I csn learn in class and from the process because it\u2019s just me and a screen not 400 other heart beats and shufflings. I\u2019ve managed to start going to gym 3-4 times a week for the first time since highschool and I think that stems from not being so stressed about actually being at school. \nHonestly typing it out, im kinda re\u00e0lizing its less the online format and more so the fact my anxiety and stress has been reduced 100fold that leaves a lot more of my brain free but \nTLDR: anyone else finding online school is helping them more than hindering, especially with some aspects relating to dealing w symptoms of mental health?","1074":"First Year Online.

Just another rant. I\u2019ve struggled with mental health issues all my life and this isolation has made it 100x worse. My mental health was actually doing so well last year. Last year was my first year of uni and things were looking up for me. In the last couple months I have truly hit rock bottom. I cry multiple times a day, I don\u2019t sleep, have no appetite or motivation to do anything. I have to force myself to do everyday tasks like showering and changing my clothes. I haven\u2019t been outside in almost a week. I have zero friends. Nobody to talk to. I\u2019m more of an introverted person so at first i loved online school back in April, but i\u2019ve now realized that the only thing that kept me sane was being forced to have a routine; getting up early to drive to school, getting myself ready to look presentable to others, seeing people on campus, being in a classroom feeling like I belong, etc. I\u2019m truly rotting from the inside and dont know how much longer of this I can take. Hearing that winter 2021 and possibly even fall 2021 is going to be online sent me into a panic because if I\u2019m this bad now, I fear what my life will look like in a few months. I know everyone is in this situation right now but I just needed to rant because im not doing okay","1094":"How to gain confidence?. So, I realized this year that I cannot stop comparing myself to other people. It has been nerve-wreaking because I always see myself falling short. Everyone just seems so much better than me. And, maybe I am too hard on myself but I have no clue on how to stop. This year, I\u2019ve felt anxious many times simply because I think I\u2019m disappointing my parents or my friends are going to all be successful while I will be a failure. I\u2019ve never experienced this before university so I want to know if anyone else has experienced this and how to defeat this ominous cloud of anxiety.","1095":"I remember going to the gym on the first day too.

Of course, given the title of this post, we also are realizing the drastic effects that online teaching, COVID-19, and other stress related to university is having on this community. This post is meant to not only address but be an open platform for people to speak up and have their voices heard as things change in the world for us.\n\nLet\u2019s turn back the clocks a bit:\n\n# What happened?\n\nA couple weeks ago, a post was made to the subreddit that we identified as very concerning. Without going into details, we believe the post amplified the negative emotions we are all feeling this semester as we\u2019re either stuck in our dorms or at home. One user\u2019s comment after seeing it made it clear it was affecting them as well. So, the post was removed to avoid having other users navigating those thoughts as well. Comments were left open to continue providing the resources and support the OP needed.  We did the same thing today as well, when another post was identified and seemed very critically concerning. This action was not taken lightly.\n\n# What did the mod team do?\n\nAfter removing the post to avoid a cascade, we continued to discuss the situation at hand. We know this is not an isolated incident, as posts such as these have occurred in the past. We also know that everyone\u2019s mental health will continue to erode as the crunch before Reading Week happens, and then again in the leadup to finals. One of our moderators reached out to a member of ACCESS, an on-campus resource for those dealing with problems facing their mental health. Our conversation was focused on things that we can do for you in order to support you. This included the beginnings of setting up our own system of checks for posts to look into, using a template provided by ACCESS. However, we\u2019re also not psychologists or mental health experts. Knowing how far we can serve your best health without causing additional harm is going to be a big thing for us.\n\n# What does this mean for the future?\n\nAs we continue to set up our systems to help guide people toward ACCESS, we continue to also suggest the resources found on the side bar of the subreddit: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/comments\/eozabm\/on\\_off\\_campus\\_mental\\_health\\_and\\_other\\_resources\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/comments\/eozabm\/on_off_campus_mental_health_and_other_resources\/) \n\nWe also plan to be taking a basic training module supplied by ACCESS when it\u2019s completed. This will allow us to identify users who need help, and direct them towards the proper channels of aid as soon as possible. We will continue to support you all as best as we can, and for those who are helping each other as well, your compassion is infinite and wonderful. It\u2019s so good to see a community helping each other out. Above all else, know that when you\u2019re struggling with something, even if it doesn\u2019t look like it, someone out there cares. \n\nIf you have additional questions, resources for those struggling to get help, please comment them. We want to have your voice heard.","1102":"More positive messages for everyone who needs it. I've been seeing a lot of posts of people saying that online school isn't going well for them or that they just have other problems going on in their lives and are overwhelmed. Whether it's because of school, family, friends, relationship, or anything else that may be bothering you... keep your head up! You'll make it through this.\n\nI did terribly last semester and by terrible i mean TERRIBLE. This year has been going better for me. Maybe this year isn't going too well for you... **YET.** \n\nThing WILL get better for you! I'm sure many of us are having a hard time adjusting to the different 'school' environment. You aren't alone.\n\nMaybe some of these things that help me when I'm down will help you:\n\n1. Talk to someone. It's simple. If you have a family member, a friend, or even a pet... letting all your feeling out may help you.\n2. Listen to some music. Something that can hype you up? Or if you're studying, maybe some lo-fi or orchestral music.\n3. Try playing a game. I play games all the time (maybe too much), but try playing a quick game that isn't too distracting. I've been taking care of a virtual plant (game is called **viridi**) and I take a few minutes of my time to water it everyday. \n4. Draw, write, or just scribble something on paper.\n5. If you play an instrument, maybe find a song that you like and try learning it.\n6. Get up and walk around. Look outside. This is mostly to rest your eyes. Sometimes when I'm looking at my monitor or a screen for too long I tend to lose focus.\n\nThese may not work for you. But they are some of the things **I** do when I'm feeling down.\n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to, I'm all ears (or eyes). I'm sure there are many people who are also open to talk. Maybe you'll make a new friend :). \n\nLastly, to those who think life isn't worth living, there are many things to live for. Our brains tend to focus on the negatives. The positives may just be hiding from you. What I realized is that when I talk to someone about my problems, they tend to point out some positives that I may have overlooked.\n\nRemember, take a break from studying. Even if you have a midterm or a test the next day, take a few minutes to get up and walk around. Get some water. Pat your dog's head. \n\nYou can do it!","1103":"Not cool STATS 235 team... Not cool.. Thanks for giving us an exam that had 2\/3 of the regular time given in previous years. I knew we were only going to be given 2 hours so I was practicing with that time frame getting 80s on all three practices but now I feel like I'll be lucky if I get a 60. I didn't fall asleep till 3am stressing over the early start and so my mind clarity this morning was completely ruined and not representative of my abilities. The extra time would have allowed me to to finish properly given my slow pace because of the lack of sleep. Paul you keep mentioning exam stress in your lectures but you did nothing to mitigate it, you only made it worse this time around when so many people are already having a hard time with school being online.

I am a second year engineering physics student who never really learned how to become a responsible student until October of this year.

I\u2019m most likely going to take 5-6 years to finish my degree while taking summer classes as well so I don\u2019t have to take 7 classes a semester but also so I can focus on student groups and volunteering throughout the school year.

I've absolutely had it with the complaints about this semester.  I simply don't get how some of you are in university but can't comprehend that that being a university student means having to manage your time, being responsible with your learning and using an array of available study strategies to cope with your course load. You constantly complain about the huge workload and that you don't have an \"ideal\" condition to learn. You know what ? I was depressed as fuck last year, lowest of the low, and coming to campus was a nightmare for me. If you have mental health issues, your experience will be hell during university whether it is in person or online. I don't understand how you can blame missing so many assignments on the fact that we are online, when there are so many planners or reminders available. You just did not plan well, or didn't even plan at all. Instructors being shitty is not new, so we sadly have to suck it up and deal with it as we would with in person classes. Classes are still scheduled at specific times, and even if they are asynchronous, you should either follow that set time or create a schedule for yourself to work on that material. No one forces you to get out of bed and attend class in person, just as no one forces you to get on Zoom and attend your lecture. If you can't jump on a Zoom call, then you most likely wouldn't have the motivation to drag yourself in to a lecture hall. I obviously know and have immense compassion (while it may not be apparent from the tone of this post) for the severity of how mental health issues can impact academic performance (experienced it first hand), but let's not exaggerate, complain and blame online instruction for being the sole reason for lack of planning, missing assignments or not attending\/falling behind in lectures. For me \"in person\" was a fucking inconvenience, but I never once complained that it was the main reason for not doing well in my classes. Right now \"online\" isn't in our control, so we need to take a more introspective approach and see how we can take effective steps and adapt to this new environment. I know it's easier said than done, but what will complaining really achieve in the long run ? Focus on the things that you have the ability to change and work on atm.","1135":"Me trying to make friends in lecture. ","1136":"What I gained this term:. 1. Weight \n\n2. Depression \n\n3.

Over the course of the year, we\u2019ve been working to develop an app to improve mental health through journaling and connecting with others. The winter months are characterized by an increase in seasonal depression, and the stressors and changes caused by the global pandemic have been hitting people hard this year. Poor mental health can be terribly isolating, so we decided to come up with an idea that would serve to connect people all across North America through their shared experiences. \n\nOne of the goals of Honest Empathy was to facilitate the connection between two people who have been struggling with the same things so they feel less alone. The app itself is still in the process of development, but we\u2019re deciding to test out the popularity and usefulness of one of the features right now.

Is this a representative sample of what the student is actually capable of? It reeks of privilege in my opinion.

My anxious brain is freaking the heck out and my intrusive thoughts are getting horribly dark (my boyfriend is keeping me safe, I promise)","1236":"Deferring Final Exams- RANT. I think the current state of exam deferrals is laughable to say the least. I can't believe in such a tough semester with all the changes people have to make because of COVID, not only to their academics, but also to their lifestyle\/housing situations\/ jobs\/etc, that the University is still keeping the same exam deferral policy. Now look I get it, you don't want every single student to start deferring exams so they can get extra time but being so uptight about granting deferrals is not the answer.   \n\n\nHow can you justify, for example, a student working insanely hard during the entire semester only to get a cold or fever right before their exam. Even if they had a 100% on all assessments up until that point, there is no way they could write to the best of their ability under those conditions. Sure a fever or cold isn't usually an \"Incapacitating illness,\" not like most people are in the hospital or anything, but it stops you from thinking clearly. Hell for most final exams they are worth anywhere between 30-50% of the grade, if you end the term (sub final) with a 100% (aka 50%\/50%) and then mess up the final because guess what you had a NORMAL human illness (that you can't even control...) you could end up losing your grade for that class because the final is worth so much (get a 60% on the final for example and end with a B- or something instead of an A+ that you had before). Or if they request a deferral and get rejected they get an F....  \n\n\nIts so deplorable that students have to basically make a gamble between should I write this exam given that I'll probably not do very well because of what I am experiencing, or should I apply for a deferral with the possibility of not getting approved and then failing the final. Its even more sad that when people come on this subreddit and consistently have to ask questions like \"I am having a panic attack, with a history of an anxiety disorder, right before my exam- should I write it?\" And the fact that most people will tell them to still write it because the fact of the matter is that the deferral might not be approved (which is true, but sad that it is)? Like what isn't that insane, mid panic attack into writing a final. Who does that even benefit? Hell I don't even care if you make the deferred final extremely hard (idk go from MC-&gt; written) but at least give people a fighting chance?  \n\n\nThe fact is that one person lying to get their exam deferred ISN'T the end of the fucking world okay ualberta admin. The system is also inherently flawed in the sense that you can't request a deferral before the exam date (at least from how I interpreted it). You MUST be incapacitated on the DAY OF your exam-&gt; thus theres no way to even guarantee you get the deferral (or if you won't so you know that you have to write it).  \n\n\nI've personally had a similar issue where I was not feeling good (to say the LEAST) in the days preceding my final. I was worried it would get worse on the day of, and it fucking did it really did-&gt; to the point where I was cringing every few minutes in pain, but I still wrote the final because guess what its a 50\/50 that even in this state where I can't think straight, am having pains every few minutes, I still can't guarantee the uni will accept my deferral. I was prioritizing studying for this final over my own mental and physical health because I simply had no other reasonable choice and that is not okay.  \n\n\nAlso, what is even the \"criteria\" for a deferral? I've seen posts on this subreddit where people state they've had X problem, and even a doctors note saying that they don't have to write the exam (or shouldn't be required to) and still getting rejected? Like holy fuck u of a get over yourself, your exams are not worth someones health (especially when they have a signed medical note).  \n\n\nRant over, sorry it was a bit disorganized.","1237":"Talking about and dealing with failure.

I decided to make this post instead of continuing crying at 4 am.\n\nI am tired of being stuck in the same circle. I'm in my 4th year and my life is the same as it was when I was a bullied little girl in elementary school. Back in elementary school, I was bullied, no one would show up to my birthday, I was sexually harassed by my best friend - yes in elementary school, and when I moved I used to get emails from the same girl telling me what everyone was saying about me. She would email me all the awful things they said behind my back.\n\nFast forward to junior high, it was a bit better but I was one of the very few visible minorities so I face a lot of discrimination by students and staff. Additionally, I was ostracized and people who I thought were my friends would ignore me for weeks and spread rumors.\n\nHigh school was better, I was still discriminated against but it was less. There was less drama and I made a lot of friends. I was used by a few people to get a good grade but overall high school was good.\n\nIn university, I thought it would get better. After all, it's huge and no one really has time for drama. I just kept to myself. As usual, I made new friends and connected with old ones. The thing is it's easy for me to make new friends they just don't last. Anyway, the first year was good until I reconnected with a friend that I was close with in junior high, she would always ask for notes and help in classes but I thought it was normal because I asked for help too. It seemed good, but she would make friends in front of me with our mutual friends and not invite me. She once brought a guy to study with us and we made small talk and since then she would always tell me to leave when they hung out or would skip her class to hang with him so I wouldn't be there. This used to happen in junior high and she had a boyfriend during that time, so I just brushed it off. Then I passed my midterm and I was talking to a mutual friend and he said she didn't: the next morning I wake up to a paragraph of her telling me that it was none of my business to know if she failed or not (even though I did not ask, he told me), and that I invaded her life, etc. She called me some names then blocked me on everything and the guys that hung out with her did the same. Then my closest friend at the time kept wanting to hang out over the summer, and I did make time for her but at that time my mum was out of the country and my sister was in the hospital so I was taking care of my younger brother and nephew. One time we made plans, but I told her ahead of time that I will be late because I had to take care of my nephew. I was on my way to meet her when I couldn't find my nephew and had to go look for him in all of his friends' houses - still, I let her know. I was about half an hour late and when I showed up, I couldn't find her because she left and didn't even tell me, another friend let me know. She stopped talking to me for two years. I ended up breaking the silence because it got too awkward.\n\nIn the second year, there was a lot of talk behind my back in my friend group but it didn't bother me because by that point I learned to be more confident. I just spent less time with them. Second-year was my best. They would make friends and not invite me, and when I confronted them they would tell me things like we didn't think you'd be interested.\n\nIn my third year, I made a few new friends. Three of them would only text me when they needed something and ignore me for days. One of them would always get mad at me if I ask him why he leaves me on read and would get really mad when I would disagree with something he said. He would always get mad about little things and every time I took time away from him, he would come around and pretend to care about me. We also had mutual friends and were in the same club, but he would not acknowledge me in public only over text or study if it was just us two.\n\nFast forward to this year, I was made fun of every single time I met up with my volunteering group. I would be the center of every joke and anytime I tried to stand up to myself they would play the victim card and turn on me even more. They humiliated me in private and publically on social media. Yesterday, I reached out to a friend to vent out my frustrations and he basically said I deserve it.\n\nI'm NOT looking for sympathy, so please don't. I just wanted to let this out because I'm tired of this pattern, if you know me I tend to be outspoken and confident but I always feel bad about hurting someone's feelings so I tend to walk on eggs shells making sure what I say isn't offensive. I wouldn't say I'm nice but I do try to treat people with respect. So I don't understand why this happens to me and I don't want this to be the trend for my life. I hate how people can just throw away my friendship on something so stupid like missing a hangout or passing a midterm - am I not worth anything to them? I'm graduating and basically, I am terrified of this being my life.\n\nThank you for reading this and I'm sorry for bumming anyone out!

Hi folks,\n\nFor context: I am 29 and halfway through a B.A. after degree (History major, Pol S minor). My first degree was a BSc in Animal Health, completed in 2017. I didn't love my first program and talked myself out of applying for almost every relevant job after graduation. I ended up spending 3 years working in a corporate role of a women's retailer. I also struggled with mental health during my first degree and finished with like a 2.5. Abysmal.\n\nI decided to go back to school in 2019, and had originally planned on spending a year or two boosting my GPA and then applying for an B.Ed after degree, secondary route. I have fallen in love with my program and am now thinking about grad school. (My GPA over the last 30 credits is 3.8, so after the coming year I should be able to overcome my troubled first degree on any application).\n\nHere's the thing, I am 29, single, saddled with student debt, and have a hard time comparing myself to the \"progress\" made by other people my age. If I were to pursue an MA I wouldn't start until I was nearly 31. It feels a) isolating to be the only person I know my age still in an undergrad and b) daunting to consider starting a grad program in my 30's and then still really be at the drawing board stage of my career.\n\nAnyone in an undergrad or masters who is near or over 30, I need to hear from you! Please either tell me that it's okay to be here, or to turn around and run the other way.   \n\n\nTL;DR: I am nearly 30, in an undergrad, and feeling daunted about the prospect of being this age and still in school, or at ground zero, career wise. Advice from fellow 30-somethings appreciated.","1261":"Online Office Hours. Honestly the best thing about online classes.

So the total is 5+12.53+7.76+(30.5\/83x100\u00d70.64)=48.8% which is C as this class was curve and this is how she made. However, on the beartrack it says I got 45% and got C-. \n\nAm I wrong?

So I am pretty much in a depressing situation right now, I\u2019m not giving up yet and I just need someone to tell me there is hope still. I am in first year and just finished all my my finals. I got an F in Eng 130 (I should have withdrawn but I was convinced I could still make it) and I also anticipate failing MATH 100. Other classes I did pretty much average. I have contacted advisors but they haven\u2019t responded yet. I\u2019m just wondering if there is hope and what\u2019s the best course of action. I take responsibility as I have slacked off and procrastinated a lot. Family problems and ADHD don\u2019t help either. Right now, I just feel like a failure and I did pretty good in High School.

Looking through this subreddit I realized that this exam session is tough for a lot of us. This has been a challenging term but we got through it; whether you failed every class or got straight As shouldn't matter because we gave it all. Sometimes it just takes someone to believe in us and I believe in every single one of you. If you had a bad term then I'm sure you will bounce back, if you improved a lot then congratulations on having all your hard work rewarded. No matter what happens, don't feel ashamed and BE PROUD OF YOURSELF. Exams are almost done and for many of us they are done and the results might not be what you had anticipated and that is totally fine. Don't let your grades destroy your mental health, don't let it convince you to take your own life. If you have nobody else to tell you this then hear it from me: I am truly proud of you. We will all get through this together and it's never too late to bounce back and change. You got this, I believe in you!","1268":"Peter Lougheed Internet.

I have a lot of drive, which manifests as short bursts of energy and productivity, but I lack the discipline to carry through tasks from start to finish. I've never really been good at setting goals or working toward them, at least not since grade 11 when I developed symptoms of severe anxiety. But more recently I've been struggling hard to create any sort of goal for myself, or... well, I just don't know what I'm doing or why I'm here. I feel sad and empty a lot. I was told I've been showing symptoms of depression, which is a whole other monster I'm learning to fight; it really terrifies me.\n\nMy point is, I do want a good future for myself. I want to go to grad school and become a molecular biologist, and if I can't do that, I'd like to be a lab tech for one (yes, I know neither of these careers pays very well, but they're what I want). I just don't know how the heck to get myself there, because no matter how much I try, I'm not able to do the small things. I try to set goals but I can't follow them and I don't know why.

Thanks!","1283":"Dear First Year. **I don't know who needs to hear this or if anyone will read this but I'm in my 4th year now and want to tell you a few things.**\n\nFirst of all, I'm so proud of you for finishing your first semester. It's so hard being a first-year in general, but you had to do your first-year during a global pandemic.\n\nIf you got those A's I'm proud of you. If you failed a couple of courses (or all), I'm still proud of you because you got through it. Some of you may be used to being that kid that always got honors with distinction in high school but suddenly find yourself struggling to pass. You're not going crazy or getting dumber, you've been thrown into a new environment where your highschool habits won't cut it. I'm saying this because this happened to me.\n\nI had a 95% average in grade 12, scooped up scholarships and early admissions, and then got punched in the gut really hard by uni. In my first year, I suffered from anxiety, undiagnosed depression, imposter syndrome, and shitty study habits. My GPA was 1.8 at the end of my first year and I felt like I lost myself. I still had an active social life and pretended I was still the same person from high school so those around me wouldn't be able to tell that I was broken inside.\n\nIt was also a really confusing time for me because I saw people who pulled 70's in highschool get A's. That's when I began to realize- I'm not entitled to good grades because I've been the \"smart\" or \"good\" kid.\n\nIn my 2nd year I continued to suffer but improved a bit. I was taken off academic probation and went from a 1.8 to a 2.8 GPA. That summer I lost my friend to suicide. I was a train wreck, I FINALLY decided to get professional help. Therapy saved me.\n\nIn my 3rd year, the first semester went pretty well. By the second semester, I had finally learned what study habits worked for me and worked my ass off. I also started asking for help from the TA's and the professor. I asked all the questions I thought were \"dumb\" but first-year me would've never had the guts to ask. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, those grades are just written as CR\/NCR on my transcript but, I know if they weren't I would have been so proud of the improvement in my results.\n\nI took spring and summer courses to try and raise my GPA and get more credits. I lost my aunt to COVID-19 during this time. It was hard but because I had gone to therapy, I applied strategies I'd learned for how to process, feel, and cope with my pain. I managed to finish with a 3.5 overall GPA for spring\/summer 2020.\n\nIn the first semester of my 4th year (Fall 2020), my mental health did take a toll due to anxiety and isolation but I managed to finish so far with a 3.82.\n\nI wanted to tell you my story because when I failed my first course or got that probation email I felt so alone. I had no one to tell out of shame and embarrassment. I thought my entire degree was a write off. But I'm telling you right now **asking for help is the best thing you can do for yourself.** Whether it's asking your TA's about concepts you don't understand, seeking therapy or getting in touch with the ombudsmen to navigate plagiarism accusations- *just do it.*\n\nThings won't get easier, but you're going to get stronger. Don't join clubs or committees for your resume or scholarships, you're going to burn yourself out. Do shit you actually care about, because then you're not going to turn into some idk premed zombie, you're going to preserve the authentic human you are.\n\nAnd yeah even with my 2.8 GPA i was still getting generous scholarships from the U of A because sure my grades sucked but we're more than our grades. I found a job. I found research positions with professors who chose to look past the stain on my transcript and give me a chance.\n\nLean on people you love whether it's family or friends. It's okay to not take a full course load. It's okay to not finish your degree in 4 years. The average time to complete an undergrad degree is 5 and 1\/2 years. You're going to make it through. You're going to redo your failed courses and be okay. You are loved. You are enough. You are stronger than you know.\n\n\\*\\*Virtual Group Hug\\*\\*","1284":"Happy New Year y'all!

From: Alex Brown\n\nDate: Wed, Dec 16, 2020 at 9:08 AM\n\nSubject: Eclass outage of Dec. 11: Failure of Leadership\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear President Flanagan and Provost Dew,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter nearly 18 years at the University of Alberta in the Department Chemistry, where I am now a Professor and, for most of the past 7 years, the Associate Chair (Undergraduate), I have learned to be patient about messaging from this university; however, after more than 96 hours since the eClass outage last Friday, my patience has worn thin. During an outage impacting 100s to 1000s of students, 10s of faculty and instructors, as well as TAs and staff running the teaching enterprise including assessment, there was ZERO communication from any central unit including IST. I do not consider a Tweet and an ITPulse announcement simply stating eClass was down at all sufficient as a communication to the 1000s of people impacted. For nearly two hours, students, instructors, and support staff flew blind with absolutely no information about what was going on from a central resource (Registrar, IST). Thus, instructors, guided by ACUs and the Faculty of Science, had to make split second decisions without sufficient, read ANY, information about the state of eClass. In the following days, after receiving numerous emails from students, their parents, faculty and instructors, it is clear this complete failure of communication downloaded huge stresses onto an already overwhelmed community of learners and educators. If the response during the event was pitiful, the communication after the event has been shameful! The Dean of Students\u2018 message, which is \u201cconveniently\" buried three pages deep from the university\u2019s main web page, says nothing but rather is filled with platitudes. Moreover, no university-wide statement, e.g, via the university\u2019s email distribution lists, has been made by senior leadership (President, Provost, VP-IT, Registrar) addressing the incident, empathizing with students, faculty and instructors on the incredible stress this has put them under, and, perhaps more importantly, filling them with any confidence that this might not happen again. Rather students and instructors, with remaining exams, have been left white-knuckling every minute of every exam in the hope that eClass does not once again collapse under the load. Meanwhile, it has been left to individual faculty members, departments, and Faculties to clean up this mess while senior leadership ignores the student (and public) relations disaster caused by this incident. Clearly, the senior leadership wishes to sweep it under the rug by simply not messaging students and also instructors about what happened and what can be done. Overall this incident, and subsequent communications, have been a failure of leadership at the highest levels of the university. Regretfully, at a time in our history when the University of Alberta needs to be served by  strong and capable leadership, the events of last Friday and non-response over the past few days has clearly demonstrated that it is sorely lacking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have cc\u2019ed this message to my colleagues in the Faculty of Science (Dean, Associate Dean (Undergraduate), Assistant Dean (Programs and Operations), and my fellow ACUs), who have worked tireless over the past 9 months to ensure the best possible learning environment for our students; in the past four days, many, if not all of us, have redoubled our efforts especially in light of the huge mental toll this incident has taken of students and instructors. What have you done, or are planning to do, to publicly address the Dec. 11th incident as well as provide guidance to an increasingly disheartened academic community?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsider me disappointed,\n\nAlex\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlex Brown, Professor and Associate Chair (Undergraduate)\n\nW4-70D Gunning\/Lemieux Chemistry Centre\n\nDepartment of Chemistry","1297":"Thinking about math 100 makes me nervous and depressed.

My mental health was actually improving up until now, but let's see how it is after I see my math mark.

I've always felt like a misfit since elementary so I would cope by making up an imaginary world and pretend to live there in my head. As I got older, this continued but on and off. I would instead use books, writing, shows, movies, and music to escape my reality. I know it's kinda maladaptive but it beats feeling the immense loneliness that I experience. \n\nI grew up being discriminated against and feeling that people view me differently always gave me anxiety. As I got older, this realization that I'm different became more apparent by I just ignored it. Every time I would get best friends, they would stab me in the back, some bullied me, and even one assaulted me. I always feel really lonely even though I have friends, I don't feel like I can connect with them. There always seems to be this barrier between me and the world. I was happy about classes being online because I thought it would be easier to avoid people but I was wrong - in one of my volunteering groups, I would always be left out of the group chats and made the butt of every joke. A few classmates of mine even embarrassed me on the zoom call in front of the entire class last semester.\n\nEven though my depression and anxiety never fully went away, things had gotten better for a while but everything has gotten worse again.

I am having a mental break down because I just got 4\/5 of my grades back. despite the hard work I put in for school, I still cannot at least get the Jason Lang scholarship with this semester. Home studying sucks as I have to babysit 24\/7 with careless, lazy, disrespectful, trash parents. I don't want to live on my own because I don't even have my learners or have a job due to COVID. Even if I do have a part-time job, I won't be able to sustain myself if I want to do well at school full time.\n\nMy family is not even supportive of my study as they think I'm just staring at my computer all day long despite me already babysitting, doing chores, and doing volunteer work. Studying from home sucks. I can never be in a quiet place for many reasons. All the unnecessary external stress pressure from my family and significant others are so overwhelming. \n\nI only understand now why some people are taking a year off when it is switched online. Most of the time, I think to myself whether it is because I'm too stupid to get at least a 3.2 GPA like the previous years and if I'm too stupid to be the perfect daughter who doesn't study and just take care of kids all my life for free. \n\nOne thing I know for sure is that life isn't fair to everyone.

Finance is a common source of stress for people, so we at Mental Health Copilots have brought together a few tips for coping with financial stress, as well as general tips for budgeting in the future. \n\n\u00b7 Avoid temptations. If you must go somewhere to purchase a good, limit your time in the store. This applies to online shopping as well, as browsing may be as tempting as in-store shopping, if not more.\n\n\u00b7 Actively track your spending. Automated spending takes little thought, so recording how much you spend in a day will allow you to alleviate any uncertainties within your budget. \n\n\u00b7 Declutter your budget. For example, if you find that you buy too much fruit which end up spoiling, lessen the amount you buy. Every little bit counts!\n\n\u00b7 Plan out your income and your expenses. Ideally, your expenses should be less than or equal to the amount that you earn in a financial cycle. By sticking to a strict schedule, you learn to budget better, as well as earning yourself more financial freedom.\n\n\u00b7 Prioritize important categories first. Take care of your necessities before budgeting for anything else. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe are a non-profit organization based in Alberta that serves to provide and discuss topics on mental health and make resources of various topics more accessible.

Save loose change in a piggy bank, it will add up!\n4. When purchasing a product do online research, then a research trip, and if you still want the item, then do a purchase trip\n5. Avoid spending triggers such as special deals, boredom, stress, or situations\n6. Consider used items through garage sales, thrift stores, or Facebook marketplace\n7. Save extra income you earn from birthday money, lottery winnings, or extra paycheques. You can implement the 50% rule: save half, spend half.\n8. Institute a waiting period for any purchase you wish to make that is over a certain limit and ask yourself if you really need it and if you can really afford it\n9. Calculate the cost of the item in terms of hours worked. Is the benefit you will receive from an item worth the time spent working in order to pay for it?\n10. Be content with what you have.

Snowboarding\/skiing, skating, sledding are all winter activities that get you moving.\n* Indulge in things you find comforting! Whether that be wrapping yourself in a cozy blanket, lighting up a candle, taking a bubble bath, watching your favourite TV show, or enjoying a hot drink.\n* Reach out to your support system!

Adapting to remote learning has required a tremendous amount of creativity, training and hard work from students and instructors alike. University is never easy--at its best it challenges all involved to push beyond expectations. But add in the complications and demands of new technology, odd learning schedules, new forms of assessment, and online classroom dynamics and the pressures can be overwhelming and detrimental to mental and physical health.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our student leaders raised a number of important issues at GFC.

Regularly attending class in the middle of the night is unsustainable and can result in highly adverse impacts on the personal health and wellness of our students. We heard that in some courses assessment methods, particularly participation grades that may in effect require students to attend class in the middle of the night, need to adapt to better reflect the realities of online learning. Online proctoring tools can increase student anxiety during an assessment by requiring students to show where they live, be in an interruption-free space with bright lighting, maintain a stable internet connection, maintain consistent eye contact with a webcam, all while undergoing the stress of writing an exam. Rural students may face difficulties because their access to the required technology cannot be achieved or guaranteed. Students who parent may face conflicting time commitments just when they need to be in class themselves.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Many of these issues are shared issues. Instructors also face time constraints and conflicts with familial demands. Overcoming the challenges of delivering course material remotely takes hours of extra preparation. Alternative and non-traditional forms of assessment add time and effort to an already overloaded schedule. An enormous amount of work has been done by highly dedicated U of A instructors to provide the best possible learning experiences for their students in a very difficult time.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I want to acknowledge and thank both students and instructors for all of the work that has been done to adapt. While there is hope on the horizon, we will continue to rely on remote learning environments through Spring and Summer terms and so we must continue to work together to improve things, address issues as they arise, and put in place solutions.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is no one easy solution and the critical starting point is always a conversation between students and instructors to first identify any barriers and then to develop alternatives. We know that conversations like these are happening everyday and alternatives are actively being put in place. We are committed to ensuring that no one is left with an unresolved situation. Provost Steven Dew and I want to assure students of the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where students have medical, technological, accessibility, or other barriers, the university is fully committed to providing reasonable solutions.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Students, especially those in other time zones and rural locations, with legitimate limitations in their ability to participate in synchronous learning and assessment will be offered reasonable course adaptations.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Students who experience barriers due to medical, disability, or other protected grounds must be reasonably accommodated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are also committed to ensuring that students and instructors have tools and resources to help break down the barriers, clarify expectations, and resolve individual issues. The Dean of Students is available to support all these conversations as needed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Finally, Provost Steven Dew is immediately striking a Task Force on Remote Teaching and Learning. This group will include students and instructors and will facilitate participation from across the university. As a priority, the Task Force will move quickly on the issue of online proctoring, with the immediate goal of reducing as much as possible the use of any online proctoring in the upcoming spring\/summer term. The Task Force will also develop a fast and effective process for identifying and addressing other issues as they arise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I want to end with a note of gratitude. COVID-19 has for the moment changed university life deeply; we must work together as best we can to maintain the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff during this global pandemic. Until we can return to normal, extra efforts will continue to be needed and I am deeply thankful for all that has and will continue to be done. Above all, I want to express my sincere thanks to our student leaders for bringing some critical issues to the fore and all our dedicated instructors and administrators who are doing all they can to support our students during this challenging time. I ask that all of us continue to keep the lines of communication open, so that we can work together to handle the many challenges we face together.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bill Flanagan  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;President and Vice-Chancellor","1345":"Doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, but to the graduating engg kids who didn\u2019t already know:.

Don't get me wrong - I definitely appreciate the lectures being recorded, but I keep going back every few seconds in case I missed something important (and everything seems important), and eventually it takes me 2-3hrs to get through a 1hr recording...\n\nI tell myself I'll try not to pause or replay, but I end up doing it anyway. It is terribly inefficient.","1363":"Any experiences with university Or outside of university mental health services. My mental health has taken another nose dive, like it does periodically. I\u2019ve suffered from anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. I\u2019m just struggling to keep up with work or even to want to do it.\n\nI\u2019ve heard some bad experiences with the university mental health services. I\u2019m not sure where else I can go in this province or even the cost of getting help.","1364":"High school kids applying. This is just my opinion but I\u2019m surprised so many people are applying for uni this year honestly as a current student I would\u2019ve definitely taken a gap year. And in the mean time, learn some tech skills online, read, try to get a job\/internship, heck idk maybe even start a YouTube channel (or at least learn how to edit videos). Seriously guys if any of you are feeling confused or reluctant about going to uni this year, that\u2019s my advice. Despite the efforts of the profs, online school is seriously not worth paying full tuition, so the less of it you have to do, the better lol. Mental health issues are rampant and largely unaddressed by the universities. And it requires ALOT of self motivation to learn, especially when you can\u2019t see other students in classes. Something to think about if you\u2019re a HS student in this subreddit.","1365":"Staying up for classes.

I\u2019ve been staying up till like 6am and waking up at 12-1pm since this semester started but now I feel like it\u2019s taking a real toll on my health and especially mental health. The only reason I do stay up is because a lot of classes though having uploaded recorded lectures, still have exams at class time so I\u2019d have to stay up for those anyway. Idk but I\u2019m getting a little depressy with staying up so late and my eating and sleeping patterns are just not it. \nI really wish all profs made these accommodations so international students can have a healthy sleep schedule because I think staying so late is seriously impacting our health. \n\nWhat are you guys doing?? I\u2019m kinda thinking of switching to a normal schedule (like sleeping at 11pm\/12am and waking up at like 7am) and just sucking it up &amp; staying up for exams....","1366":"Tell me fall semester destroyed your mental health without telling me fall semester destroyed your mental health.

I\u2019m not sure what to say really. It\u2019s a long story which I\u2019ll cut short. This is a message for those at the University who will go through this again. Don\u2019t expect the University to help, and don\u2019t expect the courts to do any justice. I have blurred the names and stories slightly so I do not release their identity. \n\nAbout 3 years ago my friend who studied here was raped by another university student. The actions taken by the university to accommodate my friend were atrocious. \n\n1. The university provided lawyers so many years later. Before that they told my friend that they had to pay for a lawyer. They are not financially there to afford a lawyer. \n\n2. All court hearings are either on Mid Term Exam days or Final exam days. WTF. I was speechless. Each time my friend had to convince them. Each time a note. Each time a meeting. Professors didn\u2019t believe them.  \n\n3. Apparently DNA evidence is not sufficient to convict someone. Neither are bruises etc. Oh and also don\u2019t forget that even if you have bruises in pictures and they heal after it won\u2019t be considered a violent act. \n\n4. Your story will be retold a dozen times by you to everyone. Be prepared to talk about how you were raped repetitively and in detail. Every choke, every tear, every position etc. Be sure to remember what panties you were wearing and whether they were slutty because that\u2019s a big factor in whether \u201cyou were asking for it\u201d. A person can\u2019t just wear it to feel good. \n\n5. Be sure to understand that after going through 3+ years of proceedings that the accused will get released. Charges mean nothing. \n\n6. The judge will tell you the same thing happened to them and that things don\u2019t change. The judge also said that rape doesn\u2019t get reported at this university because nothing gets done. The judges cried with my friend and told them that this is just how things are. Well that\u2019s very reassuring. Thanks. \n\n7. The person that raped them at the time also studied there and the University didn\u2019t do anything about it. They continued to study there even after. Nothing will go on that persons record. They walked a clean slate. \n\n8. The University asked whether they could put this on the news media to get more attention. No like wtf. Society doesn\u2019t treat women who are raped fairly. \n\n9. My friend was told that they were asking to get raped because of what they wore. Yes this is the defence everyone. Your word will get twisted and framed in a way that you were at fault.\n\n10. My friend woke up passed out and violated. Their was DNA fucking evidence and motive. Wtf do they need? \n\n11. Friends don\u2019t help. Actually they won\u2019t even stand on the witness because they are scared of being revealed. They don\u2019t want to be associated with the person that got raped. \n\n12. Lawyers , friends, family - everyone telling you you\u2019re making a big deal out of it. Please don\u2019t report it. \n\n13. The judge said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry if the person who raped you does it again, they will get caught and someone will do something about it\u201d. WOW. WTF DOES THAT MEAN. \n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of those who are raped or have gone through some level of harassment. \n\nI will say this. The system broke a person. My friend no longer trusts anyone. They longer trust a system that is supposed to protect the innocent and convict the guilty. How can they? It breaks my heart to see them everyday knowing a part of them is destroyed. Being told at every turn that these charges will land on them but nothing. At the end the defence won. What do I say? I\u2019m speechless. I\u2019m heart broken. This is possibly the most innocent person I have ever met and they were raped. They were harassed. They deserve justice. \n\n\nI am now married to this person and I love them wholeheartedly. They did not deserve this. It left scars. Permanent ones. After 3+ years or rehashing stories, taking time off from work, from school, and going to court and talking about and being promised something will get done. Nothing will change. I\u2019m sick and tired of the system being unfair.\n\nI am calling it out in hope someone who can do something about this will  contact me. Please show me some light. I want some justice. It is my duty as a citizen and as a person who loves them. \n\nThe system is not fair. My wife now tells people to not report it because of the mental strain it\u2019ll take on a young woman, man, or child. Thank you world for hurting another good person.","1370":"Jay Brinker Abnormal psych. Is any one getting their ass HANDED to them in that class??!?!?

I'm a first year student and last semester, although it was a huge pain in the ass, ended quite well. This semester however, I'm getting grades I never thought I'd get- 60s and low 70s. Most of these grades were on quizzes and other stuff that's not worth much, but i got a 65 on a bio midterm worth 10%. Reviewing it, I realized that I just didn't think properly about the problems (they were based on applying knowledge) and all of the mistakes I made were literally so dumb. The problem is, I don't know WHY I'm struggling so much; I study every day, I do a ton of practice questions and I memorize all of the relevant stuff. Granted, I am taking 5 classes and 4 of them are stats\/science but it's not the most difficult material in the world. I'm genuinely really scared for upcoming midterms because if I mess up this badly on quizzes and small assignments, the test anxiety will just make the situation worse.\n\nI'm doing my prereqs for a professional program so dropping any classes isn't really an option.","1372":"Reading week didn't cut it, I've got absolutely no motivation to do school tomorrow.

So far, I haven\u2019t seen any cheating or direct answer-giving in any of the discord\u2019s that I\u2019m in and most people say that the discord\u2019s have been helping them learn the content so much. Also, during exam time (in which we were recorded using SEM) the discord\u2019s would always be locked until the exam was done. \n\nNot only that, literally every person I\u2019ve talked to has said how much it has improved their mental health as they are able to vent their frustrations to others who understand. When classes were in person it was very very rare to befriend and talk to a group of 5+ people who were going through the same struggles as you so it was easy to feel overwhelmed and like you\u2019re the only person who \u201cisn\u2019t understanding the material.\u201d In some way, people have said that the discord\u2019s allowed them to feel like a part of a small community since many of us have been struggling with isolation and loneliness and it was nice to have a community of people going through the same things as you.","1374":"Pandemic blues and withdrawals.

I already tried to take my life last semester and failed. I still think about taking my life everyday despite being on a very large dose of anti-depressants. It\u2019s a very painful life to live.

Lets face it: this semester has been a rip off. Students are paying thousands of dollars for less support and lower quality education on Zoom University (TM), not to mention horrible mental health conditions and stress. This, as Jason Kenney and the UCP gut post-secondary education through austerity, budget cuts, massive tuition hikes, and layoffs for educational support staff. I think it is fair to say that the costs of economic crisis and of the pandemic are being categorically shifted onto students, workers, and the youth. \n\nI don't know about you, but I want a future. I want generations of students after me to have a chance to go to an affordable university and get a well-paying job. The UCP however, is pulling the rug out from under us. When Jean Charest tried to raise university tuition in Quebec in 2012, the full force of students stood up to the government and demonstrated in the streets against this policy. A full half of students in Quebec went on strike to oppose the government's decisions. Students faced police repression, anti-protest laws (not unlike the ones the UCP has passed here in Alberta) and other government means of shutting up the students and forcing through the tuition hikes. The opposition of the students led to the proposed increases being halted. These events did not take place in a vacuum - and the lessons that were learned from them are extremely applicable today in Alberta. It's not just the students - people everywhere are seeing the effects of Kenney's 'wealth before health' approach to the pandemic and the generalized attack on labour rights and conditions across the province. If you're against Kenney's attack on education and public services, if you're a student and feel like you're being ripped off this year, pr if you're interested in the fight for free tuition, please come out on March 24 at 7pm MST to our event. We will be discussing these questions and more. I hope to see you there!","1402":"Physl 372 Midterm 2. So... That test was a little brutal. I think it's pretty inconsiderate that we are expected to read and answer long complex questions with that little amount of time. The test may aswell be less than a minute per question with the amount of reading you have to do, and with each question you get wrong being like removing a percentage off your final grade. Not only that but we cannot review the exams nor see where we stand in the class in terms of percentages, which is absurd that we are put under this stress considering the circumstances we are in with online school. Does anyone want to create a discord or send a group email to see if we can do something abut this? Maybe suggest getting more time but making the exams proctored...","1403":"Any tips for a burnt out student?. I know people are going through it, but I don't understand how people are performing well rn. I did good last semester but the burn out is real this sem.

I know marks aren\u2019t a reflection of worth or whatever but I doesn\u2019t feel that way. The only thing keeping me going is the fact that a lot of other people in the class did poorly. It took like an hour to just get into office hours cause so many people were upset.

I'm a first generation university student, my family's home is in foreclosure, and I can't move back in with them. I can't see anyone irl because of the virus. I \\*want\\* this degree but I feel like I just can't do it. I know that I could realistically do everything if I stuck to a schedule, but I just can't bring myself to actually follow any schedule that I create. People say I need to take time to focus on something besides school, but I feel like the issue is that I focus on anything except school. I do take walks, I do have hobbies, but I spend a ton of time on them and then I don't get anything done. I'm not from Edmonton and I can't meet up with what few friends I've managed to make since I've moved here. I'm trying to look forward to the summer but if I fail a course I am going to have to retake it over summer and I don't know if I can handle that. I've reached out to the mental health resources at UAlberta, but they are so difficult to access that its draining just to \\*get\\* help. I had to wait a month to talk to someone and then I managed to sleep through our appointment. Everything just feels impossible, I have to do taxes for the first time and I'm trying to keep up with groceries and bills and I'd just rather not think about any of it.

You can't just delete your thread when I blow you out.. Original thread was about how scholarships and awards from the University\/SU are unfair\/unethical\/not transparent. I was on the SU Involvement Awards Committee last summer. You're woefully misinformed. I can't share details since I signed an confidentiality agreement, and they asked us to direct people to them for questions.\n\nWhat I can say is that the SU Involvement Awards is mostly fair and equitable, in my eyes. In fact, it's one of the few things I think the SU does right. They pride themselves on how much cash they can give away and we worked with them to try and maximize the amount given out (the final awards selection spreadsheet keeps track of the dollar amount awarded and the SU staff we work with seemed really stoked by how big that number was getting). I did notice that there were certain themes that the SU focused on in whittling down the larger application pool into the smaller one (i.e. diversity\/equity), which I thought was a bit biased. But other than that, it's very straight forward.\n\nI posted a thread on [r\/ualberta](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ualberta\/) a couple of nights ago about how the students here suck at writing, and all I got was someone being a jerk going \"lol guess whatever you're a part of must not be important so students don't give a shit, ya loser\".\n\nHere's some advice from someone who read 200 of your applications:\n\n1. Don't apply for the Hilda Swinson Volunteering one unless you've done something literally amazing. Everyone applies for it because it's low hanging fruit. \"Just volunteer\" --&gt; 95% of students can apply. You're wasting your time.\n2. Do something that isn't generic. A part of the problem is that if you do what everyone else does you don't stand out. Refer to the Hilda Swinson again. Lots of applications; all with minimal volunteering (because that's what the award allows for). It's a competition. Be competitive. It's not about, nor should it be about, making sure everyone gets an award. I like that it's an upward trend towards accomplishing more. You did a bottle drive one weekend? Tough luck dude, because that girl started her own charity and raised $25k in a year. git gud.\n3. Learn to write. Do not write overblown, melodramatic pieces about how you're practically a saint. We can see right through it. Do not beg for the scholarship. Tell me, explicitly, what you did. Talk about what you did, not what you were a part of. \"I was the president of x club where we focus on saving the world\" = I don't care. \"I was in x club and we accomplished new goals z and y causing abc and personally spent 500 hours reviewing the work of my teammates and in meetings with qrstuvwxyz\" = now we're talking. Notice that the first example was the president and the second example was not an executive.\n4. Get relevant, current to that year references. No references from last year. No references from your high school teacher unless it's directly relevant to your application. No references from your job. Random references = into the trash it goes.\n5. Can't stress this enough: do not write melodramatic pieces to try and make your accomplishments look better. Many students did insignificant things but tried to write their way into making it seem like you did more. Guess what? The adjudicators are all accomplished students too. We have a pretty good idea of what you did\/did not do. You aren't going to fool us. Either ground your application in reality or you're wasting your time applying for that award.\n6. That said, DO NOT LIE. Yes, some people lied on their applications. Don't ask how we know. Your shit goes straight into the trash and if I ever see your name on a resume at a workplace or grad school or admissions committee or whatever --&gt; into the trash it goes with a vengeance.\n7. Remember when I said I thought the SU focused more on diversity\/equity? Please don't shoe horn that into your application. A lot of applications were very, very, verrrrryyyyy tenuously related to that topic and very obviously tried to make what little they had done seem more meaningful by throwing in a \"with the goal of improving diversity\/equitable outcomes\". Shut up. No you didn't. You're just trying to capitalize on a trend. And besides, there are people who applied who actually did that who are going to scoop you anyways so you're wasting your time :).\n8. Try not to split your application up too much. Often times I felt like 1 paragraph wasn't enough to able to fill up my desire for giving you the award. So either \"lern 2 rite\" and make that 1 paragraph amazing, or drop one of the more half-hearted sections and further flesh out that good stuff.\n9. Again, some of you do really amazing work and I loved reading your applications. Sadly, that was mostly a lesser part of the student body. Most of you really phoned it in. It's not my fault. I want to give you the award. It's your fault for either not giving me enough information or for doing too little throughout the year.","1417":"Is it possible to ask for a lab extension to to extenuating emotionally traumatic circumstances?.

Then you have to spend the next 2 weeks trying to get in contact with the other members because for some reason these people are third year students yet don\u2019t keep up with their emails.

I haven't been diagnosed but I suspect I have a combo of GERD\/IBS that keeps getting dismissed as nothing. The doctor keeps wanting to test me for celiac's disease even though I've been tested 3 TIMES already and they keep telling me to just eat fiber and take PPIs. I'm beyond frustrated and it never gets better because nobody wants to actually investigate, on top of stress.

As much as my priority of worries should be finals, stress makes a million other things fly into my head as the rest of the year approaches. Here's a list of some and if I could get some advice to ease to my brain worries, it would be much appreciated &gt;&lt; \n\n1. Graduation - I was supposed to graduate this year but stuff happens and I'm slated to finish all my required courses by the end of Fall 2021. I know that means I would graduate in June 2022 but I just wonder if I have to sign up for classes for Fall 2021 AND Winter 2022 or just Fall 2021 is fine. \n2. Courses for Fall 2021 - What I need is a 400 Level BIOL class, another PSYCO class and two courses for credit to graduate. My plan is to take BIOL 409 or BIOL 430, PSYCO 239 and\/or 275 then maybe PALEO 200 or another BIOL type \"easier\" 200 course to try and boost my major GPA.  Is it doable? I know for BIOL 409 I have a lot of prereqs but I struggled in the topics in those classes... I'm a little more math and lab inclined so 430 seems a bit better but I'm also scared it won't work out as well.  I'm not sure overall about these course choices but I just want to finish my degree already &gt;&lt; \n3. Summer\/Part time jobs - I know job market is hard with COVID and all that but I already skipped doing anything last summer bc of COVID and other things. My parents aren't pressuring too much for a job but they are also suggesting to try and get a part time soon as my graduation approaches and such. However, my specs are pretty weak and I don't know where to start really. I had a summer job pre COVID but that was through a connection and they don't offer it anymore... I just need something to do for the summer really or else my parents are going to nag me about just sitting around for another summer :\/ \n4. Overall Career things - I had big career \/ degree plans but they fell through with the reality of university grades. So now I'm just trying to finish this Bsc at the very least. Where to go next? I have been browsing around NAIT and MacEwan things because I'm probably not going to grad school or anything... I know it's ultimately my decision what I do but just again, where to start...I basically have this summer to figure out something then scramble some applications to programs later. \n\nThose are some worries besides finals for the end of the semester. On a little bright side, I'm happy my marks aren't too bad this semester so I'm not on another verge of failing a course. However, I'm still stressed to get a decent mark on finals and if some unexpected things crash my grades. With all these thoughts, it's extra tough around this time of year.\n\nIf you read this, thanks for reading some university student's oversharing on the internet... good luck on your finals!","1454":"Mental Health Diagnosis.

So, one of my best friend got 2 RTW at UofA (1 from science and 1 from Open Studies) few years ago and she went to Athabasca (hope I spell correctly) and took 6 courses and she got 3.0 GPA and she took 2 courses at UofA this semester under Open Studies and she got 1.7 and 1.0 on each course. I believe she will get another RTW from UofA as her GPA is less than 2.0 but she has about 2.4-2.6 GPA based on her Athabasca courses and UofA and she needs 24 transferable credits. I honestly think that she is eligible to apply to the new faculty not her previous faculty. I believe she cannot go back to science and open studies as she got 2 rtw already.

Compiled with years of insight into the creed of Political Science students - who are the superior leaders of our species - and with the aid of providence, this humble servant has manifested this sacred text from the abstract into reality. All current and future Political Science students of the University of Alberta are hereby commanded to abide by this text, lest they be ousted and or rejected from our creed.*\n\n*This sacred text, which must hereby be referred to as* ***The Way****, demands great effort of those entering and currently residing in the creed of Political Science students. Though these demands may be great on one\u2019s mental and physical capacities, they are to be followed. To abide by the stipulations of The Way brings great success and distinguishes one as a proud member of our creed.*\n\n*This sacred text, which our creed refers to as \u2019The Way\u2019, is comprised of four stipulations and thirty-four articles: Concerning the Dress of the Political Science Student; Concerning the Physical Conduct of the Political Science Student; Concerning the Verbal Conduct of the Political Science Student; and Concerning the Written Conduct of the Political Science Student, the first of which contains four articles, the second of which contains sixteen articles, the third of which contains nine articles, and the fourth of which contains five articles.*\n\n*By This Humble Servant\u2019s Grace:*\n\n**First Stipulation - Concerning the Dress of the Political Science Student**\n\n1. You *must* wear a complete three-piece suit to campus.\n2. You *must* wear black, slim leather gloves - mittens are not permitted.\n3. You *must* *NOT* carry a backpack; you *must* carry a laptop bag on your left shoulder.\n4. You *may NOT* use the weather as an excuse for not abiding by the first three articles of the First Stipulation.\n\n**Second Stipulation - Concerning the Physical Conduct of the Political Science Student**\n\n1. You *must* purchase any and all coffee from Second Cup, and it *must* be black coffee - lest you be deemed unprofessional.\n2. You *must* walk up the Sciences escalator rather than the HUB escalator so that you may prove to the heathens of the lesser faculties (many of whom are your friends) that you are far superior to them.\n3. You *must* take POL S 261, described as International Relations as per the University Calendar, in the Winter semester of your first year; the people *must* know that you have a bone to pick with the United Nations, that you were a member of Model UN, and that you - our beloved future diplomat - have what it takes to guide the rest of humanity to success.\n4. You *must* visit a therapist after completing POL S 101, described as Introductory Politics as per the University Calendar, not because you need a therapist, but because you *must* show the heathens of the second article of the Second Stipulation that \u2019polisci\u2019 requires greater mental effort and that our field is a grim one.\n5. You *must* study in the Albertan Legal Study room of the second floor of Rutherford North library.\n6. You *must* take pictures with the legal texts in the prescribed study room as per the fifth article of the Second Stipulation.\n7. You *must* upload the pictures taken as per the sixth article of the Second Stipulation to social media so that the heathens of the second article of the Second Stipulation know that you are dealing with the law prior to enrolling in law school; such are the responsibilities demanded of our creed.\n8. You *may* study in the Harry Potter Room of the second floor of Rutherford South library so that you feel as though you are a Harvard student.\n9. You *must* study in either CCIS or DICE at least twice a semester so that the heathens of the second article of the Second Stipulation, as well as the unnamed ghouls of the unnamed faculty, are able to see you rummaging through your copy of Plato\u2019s *Republic*.\n10. You *must* demand an A+ during office hours if any foolish professor assigns you a letter grade of anything lesser; the \u2018+\u2019 is what will distinguish you from the imposters of our creed.\n11. You *must* hate political theory with a passion, and you *must* take further political theory courses to demonstrate that you are willing to torture yourself for success; our creed demands resilience.\n12. You *must* be capable of identifying heathens of the Business or Economics faculty who enter our sacred spaces and speak of: economic ruin; the lack of Canada\u2019s military capacity; \u201cbasic supply and demand\u201d; \u201csimple opportunity cost\u201d.\n13. You *must* make your presence known to the heathens of the second article of the Second Stipulation by purchasing a \u201csweet drink\u201d from the Starbucks in CCIS; they *must* know that you are so hardworking, that you have made such a lengthy pilgrimage for a cup of nectar.\n14. You *must* march to a nearby washroom and rid your body of the \u201csweet drink\u201d of the thirteenth article of the Second Stipulation; the body of the Political Science student *must* remain pure.\n15. You *must* submit any and all papers written under the guidance of the Fourth Stipulation to any and all undergraduate review journals.\n16. You *must* promote any and all papers published in any and all undergraduate review journals as per the fifteenth article of the Second Stipulation so that you may tell your peers that you are a published figure of our field.\n\n**Third Stipulation - Concerning the Verbal Conduct of the Political Science Student**\n\n1. You *may NOT* refer to Political Science as \u2018POL S\u2019; you *must* refer to it as \u2018polisci\u2019.\n2. You *must* speak elegantly - to the extent that your peers think you have a horrible British accent.\n3. You *must* describe any and all coffee purchased as per the first article of the Second Stipulation as \u2018potent\u2019 rather than \u2018strong\u2019 in taste.\n4. You *must* speak in seminars by beginning your sentences with \u201cA contention that I would like to advance\u201d.\n5. You *must* only speak in contention in seminars; acceptance of differing views is not a sign of superiority.\n6. You *must* only speak of the problems of the United Nations when speaking with peers.\n7. You *may NOT* go 24 hours without sharing with others your ambitions in the field of law; you will change the world, and others *must* know this.\n8. You *must* refer to professors by their first name despite being told not to.\n9. You *must* tell your peers that you are on a first-name-basis with your professors; to be on a first-name-basis is a sign of success.\n10. You *must* refer to the compilation of all four stipulations and thirty-four articles of the \u2018Stipulations to Being an Exemplary Political Science Student\u2019 as \u2019The Way\u2019; identity, uniformity, and devotion is necessary to achieve success - this is a fact not revealed to the heathens that have been hitherto referred to or discussed.\n\n**Fourth Stipulation - Concerning the Written Conduct of the Political Science Student**\n\n1. You *must* *NOT* write in clear terms; convolution is what divides our creed from the heathens of the second article of the Second Stipulation.\n2. You *must* use the word \u2018societal\u2019 in place of the word \u2018social\u2019 in your written papers; such was the way taught to our creed by our IB professors of high school.\n3. You *must* use the phrases \u2018modern liberal\u2019 and \u2018relative pluralism\u2019 in every introduction, regardless of topic; the heathens of the second article of the Second Stipulation know not what this is, and neither do you - they do not and *may NOT* know this.\n4. You *must* spend hours conducting literary research for your POL S 101 self-reflection; a self-reflection submitted without research, is a lie submitted without self-respect.\n5. You *must NOT* use any referencing format which does not include the use of footnotes; footnotes distinguish us as a civilized people.\n\n*Those wishing to enter our creed must display their respect and devotion to The Way by reciting these sacred words:*\n\n***\u201dI was an IB student in high school, and I partook in Model UN.***\n\n***I could have been accepted to Harvard for undergraduate Political Science, but I chose not to apply.***\n\n***I will apply to, and will be accepted by, all top law schools in the United States.***\n\n***I will be the future prime minister of Canada or the future president of the United States.***\n\n***This is my way; and my way is not revealed to the heathens.******\u201d***","1467":"F*ck me this hit me hard, especially this semester..

Ok hi all you new kids going through registration. How was today for you? Was it a messed up experience you wanted to have go more smoothly and just got blind sided? Yea I get that, I hear ya, WE hear ya. \n\nSo I have a degree and am back doing an After Degree. I\u2019ve been through the madness you all went through. My first time on campus we didn\u2019t have a Reddit etc to talk between ourselves. We dealt with the madness on our own and then showed up to campus not knowing anyone or what to expect, whatever. \n\nSo this is for you all. Today I and a whole group of other sr students chatted and honestly had a laugh at what was happening because some of it was just silly. We get you all have had it pretty rough with a shit gr12, missing grad or flirting in class, going to the movies with your friends and all that. You\u2019re growing up in an honestly pretty shit situation. But you\u2019re all managing to get through it because you\u2019re pushing forward into university. For that all my friends and I applaud you for simply not giving up. \n\nUp until now you\u2019ve had lots of support and help to be successful, that\u2019s great. Now you\u2019re going to get a rude awakening that the big effort to be successful is from yourself. People will not want to help you unless you show you\u2019re willing to help yourself. Today lots of you were chatting with people you know or maybe just met online. Lots of you problem solved together, that\u2019s what matters and makes you successful. \n\nYour professors, the administration\u2026 they don\u2019t care about you. You\u2019re a student number and a tuition payment to them. That being said, there are some absolute gems of profs on campus that desperately want to share their knowledge with you so you\u2019re successful. The sr students I associate with also want you to be successful because you\u2019ve gone through a pandemic during a transition year. Seriously, good job y\u2019all!\n\nSo I\u2019ve rambled and others are going to jump in and give you some words of encouragement. Some of us may have given you a bit of a rib coming in, just know it was mostly to rip on the situation over all. Lots of us got roasted when the school went online in March 2020. \n\nSo welcome to the UofA from me and my friends. If you end up on campus lost or confused for whatever reason, look for students that just look a bit older and don\u2019t be afraid to ask us whatever you need to know. Yes you can make it from ECHA to Tory in 10min but you have to run. I promise we will all make sure you first years get questions answered and get to the classroom you\u2019re looking for!\n\nLastly, don\u2019t be a bunch of cut throat little shits to each other. I had to take a class with some kid that wanted to go into Med\u2026 they were the angriest and honestly most sociopathic asshole I ever had to be near.

Hello.\n\nSo I've been showing symptoms of anxiety and depression for a few years, and I've always tried my best to deal with it on my own, which I always thought worked out well for me. But lately I've been struggling to feel like a functioning human being. Most of the time I have this feeling of emptiness in my mind. I am demotivated and lack... feeling(?) about things that should make me feel happy, sad, or even angry - as though I have no direction\/purpose and am just floating through life. And if it's not emptiness, I am feeling and thinking too much. It's too much negative emotion that I don't know what to do with it, and I just cry or have a panic attack. When it's like this I feel like I'm drowning.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else experiences similar feelings and if so, how do you manage it, aside from medication?

I\u2019ll be starting my first coop term in September 2022 so there is still a lot of time.

[By Dr. Jillian Buriak, Canada Research Chair and Professor in the Department of Chemistry]. Dear President Bill Flanagan, Provost Steven Dew, Board of Governors Chair Kate Chisholm,\n\nIn under one month, classes begin at the University of Alberta, with more than 40,000 students from around the world converging on our campuses. In addition, faculty and staff who have been largely off-site during the global pandemic will join them. We want nothing more than a normal campus experience, replete with the energy and excitement that makes campus learning and life an essential part of the educational experience. It is an understatement that COVID19 has upended this campus life, and we are about to take the first steps back to normalcy. While the vaccines are remarkably effective, they are only effective if two doses make it into one\u2019s arm. Without mandatory vaccinations, [campus shutdowns are inevitable](https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/opinion\/article-without-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-on-campus-we-will-face-another\/?utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+\/+Media&amp;utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links). \n\n**The Delta variant is a beast.** The Delta variant of COVID19 has suddenly changed the game, and will certainly not be the last variant of concern to do so. Delta is unlike the strains of SARS-CoV-2 we have dealt with in the past, with an [Ro equal to chicken pox (\\~6)](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/delta-variant-cdc-contagious-1.6124795), meaning that it is highly transmissible, with the main route being [via aerosols and respiratory droplets](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/health-professionals\/main-modes-transmission.html).  While fully vaccinated individuals, more than 2 weeks post second inoculation, are largely protected, the rates of vaccination of the [age 20-24 demographic ](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/alberta-covid-19-data-statistics-numbers-cases-hospitalizations-1.5514947)in Alberta are significantly lower than the provincial average, which is already [the lowest in the country](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/edmonton\/alberta-vaccination-rates-1.6119338). Today, fewer than half of people of this age in Alberta are fully vaccinated, with about 30% totally unvaccinated with zero shots. While we do hope that our students will have higher vaccination rates than the general population, this critical but unknown data point makes it impossible to ensure that the Delta variant does not rip through the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated segment of these tens of thousands of students, and the staff and faculty who support them, who will be walking through and sitting in very crowded settings. Combined with unknowns regarding ventilation and filtration of our classrooms and common areas, particularly in very large lecture halls, superspreader events need to be seriously considered. Aerosols of viral particles are as mobile as smoke, and without proper ventilation and HEPA\/MERV 13 filtration, superspreading is likely. Our colleague, Nelson Amaral, described succinctly the \u201csuper-mixing\u201d of students on campus (link [here](https:\/\/edmontonjournal.com\/opinion\/letters\/fridays-letters-covid-measures-needed-for-university)) in a letter to the Edmonton Journal, who said \"If we tried to design a system to rapidly spread a contagious virus during a pandemic, it would be difficult to come up with a more efficient system than the massive dynamic close proximity of university campuses.\" \n\n**Public health guidelines are insufficient for a university environment; responsibility to our stakeholders.** While the University of Alberta has stated that safety is the top priority for a smooth fall return (link [here](https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/covid-19\/about\/campus-2021-22.html)), we are extremely concerned that this plan, as outlined, could fail, and that in-person teaching and other normal activities could end prematurely. The very last thing any of us would like to see is for students, faculty, and staff to fall ill and force us to pivot back online. We also do not want our community to be the cause of additional stress on our healthcare system. We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to create a safe learning environment for all students. \n\n**Long COVID, and unvaccinated children.** Another huge concern is the faculty, staff, and students who have children not-yet-eligible for vaccination, a large and highly susceptible cohort of thoroughly COVID19-naive children. Pediatric ICU\u2019s are being overwhelmed [in some US states](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jemimamcevoy\/2021\/07\/29\/hospitals-in-southern-us-reporting-record-numbers-of-children-hospitalized-amid-delta-surge-though-deaths-still-extremely-rare\/?sh=13fe6a7c5f1e); the UK has almost identical vaccination rates to us and [cases](https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/healthandsocialcare\/conditionsanddiseases\/bulletins\/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot\/30july2021#age-analysis-of-the-number-of-people-who-had-covid-19) in children are rising. While early and playing out in real-time, some data from the UK suggests that substantial numbers of children who are infected with COVID19 still suffer from one or more symptoms 120 days later, which impair their daily lives; some data suggest as high as 40% of children are thus affected ([link](https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg24933233-600-children-are-getting-long-covid-and-being-left-with-lasting-problems\/); open access Pubmed [link](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7927578\/)). Again, this data is being collected in real time, and in the face of the Delta variant, we believe that the precautionary principle should apply. [Long COVID](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/373\/6554\/491) in adults as well also has to be emphasized, with perhaps 10-25% of those having suffered through COVID19 being affected for months, and perhaps years, with debilitating symptoms. We cannot risk substantial swaths of our community suffering from preventable long COVID. \n\n**Stress due to rational concerns and unanswered questions.** Many of your faculty, staff, and students are extremely stressed. This stress results not from an irrational fear of change (which would be more suitably termed anxiety) as we open society up, but from highly rational and science-based concerns regarding the aerosol nature of COVID19, the unknowns of ventilation in our teaching and crowded common spaces, the fact that sick people no longer are required to self-isolate, that mask-wearing is merely encouraged but not mandatory, that Delta is so highly contagious, and that long COVID can be debilitating. We emphasize that these concerns are rational, and the only way these extreme worries can be alleviated is with clear direction and information. \n\n**Our 4 Requests.** We would like to request the following as general public health guidelines are insufficient for a university campus with tens of thousands of students in these congregate and crowded settings. \n\n**1. Mandatory vaccinations** for all faculty, staff, and students on campus. \n\n**2. Mandatory masks** must be worn in classrooms, hallways. Ideally, masks would be N95-grade or similar (or ASTM2 surgical mask + a mask seal, such as a [Badger Seal](https:\/\/making.engr.wisc.edu\/mask-fitter\/)) to effectively filter sub-micron particles. Based on current data regarding the delta variant, the CDC now [recommends](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) mandatory masking in schools.\n\n**3. Measure and share ventilation and filtration data\/informatio**n for all common spaces, including classroom and lecture halls. ASHRAE clearly indicates that COVID is airborne and aerosolized (link [here](https:\/\/www.ashrae.org\/file%20library\/technical%20resources\/covid-19\/iea-bahnfleth-5may20.pdf)) and has made specific recommendations to reduce airborne infectious aerosol exposure (link [here](https:\/\/www.ashrae.org\/file%20library\/technical%20resources\/covid-19\/core-recommendations-for-reducing-airborne-infectious-aerosol-exposure.pdf)). We need to follow these recommendations, and share the information with the users of these spaces. From eACH (hourly air exchanges\/ventilation) &gt; 6, to HEPA and MERV 13 (flltration), we cannot ignore the concerns of occupants regarding air quality. \n\n**4. Institute rapid testing.** Since some fraction of the population will arrive on campus unvaccinated, vaccination clinics will take time. We will be well into October for some to develop full immunity (4 week delay between inoculations, and 2 week delay post-second dose). Start a frequent rapid testing program for these individuals. \n\nTime is running short. We hope that a rapid uptake of these ideas can make our fall semester successful. We want nothing more. \n\nYours truly, \n\n**To sign, click here:** [**https:\/\/forms.gle\/qoCPtgZcd1WK2fP29**](https:\/\/forms.gle\/qoCPtgZcd1WK2fP29)","1560":"Open letter: Request for mandatory vaccinations and masking, air quality information (ventilation and filtration), &amp; rapid testing to ensure a safe fall return to campus..

Hi everyone! I wanted to share some tips for taking tests and overcoming test anxiety. I had a lot of anxiety when taking tests, and I wish I knew these strategies a lot earlier in my degree!\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing test anxiety, it might be because you don\u2019t feel prepared for your tests. If this is the case, then you may need to do more studying or you need to determine if your study strategies are working for you. Re-reading notes or chapters in the textbook is probably the study strategy that most students use but this isn\u2019t the most effective way to study. You want to try to use a more active study strategy where you are more fully engaged with the material like making practice questions and testing yourself on the material. When we read things over and over again, we may think that we understand it because it looks familiar but we may not actually understand it or be able to apply the information during the test.\n\nYou also want to pay attention to how you\u2019re talking to yourself, both before and during the test. Our thoughts can have a big impact on our feelings and our behaviour. For example, if we tell ourselves that studying won\u2019t help and we won\u2019t pass this class anyways, that will make us feel depressed and helpless, and we likely won\u2019t feel motivated to study for the test. Instead, try to assess the situation accurately. How many hours did you spend studying? Do you understand the material? If you don\u2019t, then try to do more studying, or get help from the professor, a classmate, or a tutor.\n\nIf we\u2019re not feeling well physically, then we won\u2019t feel well mentally. This means we have to take care of our physical health to prepare for a test too. A lot of students stay up late or all night studying for exams. If you can, avoid this. Sleep helps consolidate memories into long-term memory, and lack of sleep interferes with our attention and concentration. If you want to use sleep to your advantage, take a nap after a study session. You also want to avoid having too much caffeine on the day of the exam. It can heighten anxiety and make us jittery.\n\nI also made a short video about the causes of test anxiety and more strategies to overcome it: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=syIJ0u6K1oM](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=syIJ0u6K1oM)\n\nGood luck on your tests!

I wanted to share some tips for doing well on multiple choice tests that I've learned over the years.\n\nA lot of students think you should choose C if you don't know the answer to the question. No matter what answer you choose, you'll have a 1 in 4 (or 1 in 5) chance of getting the answer right. There's no truth or reason to choose C instead of any of the other answers. A lot of times when people make tests they randomized the answers anyways.\n\nRead the questions and answers carefully. A lot of times we know the answer to the question, but we're reading too fast and misread or misunderstand the question and get it wrong. We might even get the answer right but mark the wrong circle on the test sheet. Before starting the test, make a plan for how long you'll spend on each question so you're not rushing at the end. You can also try to do something to relax yourself before the test (like taking a few deep breathes or reminding yourself you've studied a lot and you'll try your best).\n\nIf you know you have test anxiety, it might be better to avoid having any caffeine right before the test. Caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety and too much anxiety can impair our performance on the test. Try to see if there's an alternative that works for you (like drinking water, a smoothie, or something else).\n\nI also created a video about how to ace multiple choice exams if you're looking for more tips: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OpjXvXw48G0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OpjXvXw48G0)\n\nGood luck!

Hi everyone! I wanted to share some tips for time management that I\u2019ve learned over the years.\n\nI think one of the most important things to manage your time is to make a plan or use a schedule. When I have a plan for the day, I can get started on my school work and other tasks without having to think so much about what I should do first. If we plan for 1 hour, we can save several hours in the execution of the task. Usually I\u2019ll make a plan for the day the night before, so I am already mentally prepared when I wake up and I can get started right away. Making a plan doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Most of the time I just make to-do lists and that works really well for me.\n\nAnother thing that is really helpful for time management is figuring out your priorities, or what is the most important for you in life. This might be doing well in school, expanding your social circle, boosting your extracurriculars on your resumes, or spending time with your family. Everyone is going to have different priorities, but it\u2019s important to know what they are, so you can make time for them in your schedule. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to be realistic about how much time you have. Some of my professors have recommended that for every 1 hour of class, we should be spending 2-3 hours of time outside of class doing assignments, projects, or studying. We may also have a part-time job, extracurricular activities, and need to do things to care for physical and mental health, like personal hygiene, eating, sleeping, and exercising. It can be helpful to know where all your time goes in the day and in the week, and sometimes we might even have to reduce the number of activities we\u2019re involved with if we realize that we have taken on more than we can handle. Even if you could handle another activity, sometimes it can be good to have a bit of extra time for rest and relaxation. \n\nI also made a video on time management strategies for anyone who\u2019s interested: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/QhQcaC6pjN4](https:\/\/youtu.be\/QhQcaC6pjN4) :)","1684":"Would you leave if your roommate was Anti-vax?.

","1689":"I have a learning disability and was accused and Sanctioned for academic Dishonesty by the Faculty of Arts. TL;DR: Grammar errors lead to academic dishonesty charge with no reparations. \n\nIn December 2017, a professor (who will call DF) wrongfully accused me of academic dishonesty on a paper I\nsubmitted in a course. DF's only basis for this accusation was grammatical errors in my paper. He claimed that the grammatical errors demonstrated that the author was a student with an Asian first language and I could not have been the author and bought it from a paper mill. During the meeting with DF, I immediately responded with my diagnosis with dyslexia.\n\nThe following January, I met with the associate dean of the Faculty of Arts (who I will call RN). During the meeting with RN, they asked my to perform the patronizing and down right insulting task of reading my paper, which seemed to be a validity test of my disability. She had no interest in viewing my evidence that I had brought, such as the metadata of the paper. \n\nThe next February, RN declared I committed academic dishonesty and imposed sanctions. I immediately appealed. Over the next months, I met with a counsel (a lawyer who was a husband of a professor) to help me navigate the appeal process and finally in May I was unanimously granted my appeal and sanctions were removed.\n\nAfter the accusations, I was overwhelmed by the sanctions and their implications for my future, particularly because I was wanting to pursue a Master's degree. As a result of this stress, I had to resign from my job, leading to a lost income and reliance on my savings. It has absolutely ruined my confidence. All this lead to a severe depression, which because of my financial situation, I couldn't address. \n\nThroughout the process I endured a disrespectful and undignified learning experience and now that I am pursuing an after-degree, the accusation of academic dishonesty has had a clear impact on my ability to submit assignment, exams, ect. out of fear of the same discrimination. \n\nThe real kicker is that after I had won the appeal, no one from the university reached out to make sure I was ok. No resources were put in place to help me. Not even an apology or acknowledgement of the stress I was placed under. \n\nIn order to have some form of closure, I recently submitted a discrimination complaint which has been denied (due to time limit). \n\nHopefully this wasn't too long and somewhat understandable. I think everyone should be concerned about what the UofA views as there responsibility and how serious it views academic dishonesty (not enough to help the students after).

It\u2019s like a state of apathy has overtaken me and I couldn\u2019t care less about what happens but yet I do. I have not slacked off, rather I overworked myself to exhaustion due to making the stupid decision of taking an insane course load, and even after I dropped a course I am still paying the consequences now.

The guilt of failure and inevitable judgment that comes with it. To have to give out answer and be scolded for not trying hard enough. I have to work on top of all of this.

I learned a lot of this information from my undergrad psychology courses, so I thought I\u2019d share and pass on the knowledge \n\n**When is the best time to start studying?** \n\nIf you haven\u2019t started studying yet, it\u2019s probably best to start as soon as possible. In general, it\u2019s best to study\/review within 24 hours of learning class material. This is because of something called the forgetting curve. We forget most of the material that we learn after a day of learning it (\\~50-80%), but if we review it within a day, we can remember for a much longer time. It\u2019s much better for our memory to review for a few minutes over time than trying to cram\/learn everything the day before the exam.\n\n**What are some effective ways to study?**\n\nRetrieval practice is an active learning strategy where we try to recall information that we\u2019ve learned previously. It\u2019s a lot more effective than passive strategies like reviewing or re-reading notes. We can do this by closing our textbooks or notebooks and trying to recall as much information as we can remember up until that point (you can write it down or say it out loud). We can also do this by using flashcards or testing ourselves on the material. When we use retrieval practice, it will show the gaps in our understanding that we can make a note of to review later.\n\nAnother effective strategy for memorizing information and keeping it in long term memory is called elaborative rehearsal. This method involves making connections between what you are studying now and what you already know. Many students tend to use a strategy called maintenance rehearsal, where we keep repeating information over and over in hopes of remembering it. Essentially, with elaborative rehearsal you want to make the information meaningful for you. This might involve making connections between your life and the course material or coming up with your own examples for different concepts.\n\n**How can you ensure you\u2019re at your best before taking the exam?** \n\nCare for your physical and mental health throughout the semester. For example, continue to eat regularly, drink enough water, avoid too much sugar and caffeine, and get exercise. A lot of people sacrifice their sleep to study, but our brains need sleep to consolidate information into long term memory. If you have an exam in the morning, try to get enough sleep the night before!\n\nI hope this information can be helpful as you prepare for exams! I also made a video about study tips and tricks for anyone who is looking for more advice: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/lsr9mTlwokw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/lsr9mTlwokw)\n\nGood luck on your exams!

Roads and sidewalks are very icy right now and I\u2019ve seen lots of people falling down and I\u2019ve seen people saying they have fallen and hit their head and are still going to class. \n\nIf you have hit your head on the ground SEE A DOCTOR do not take this lightly. If you have any symptoms of a concussion: dizziness, headache, blurred vision, vomiting etc GO SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. Head trauma is very damaging and you need to deal with it as early as possible. I don\u2019t care if you have work, an exam or class those can all be missed and won\u2019t really matter in the long run, but ignoring a head injury can be life altering. So please please see a doctor. \n\nPro tip for walking in Edmonton on ice, always wear gloves do not put your hands in your pockets. You will regret having them in your pockets as soon as you slip.","1737":"MSA Paint Night. The MSA invites you to a Paint Night on Friday December 3rd!

I study every day for a minimum of around 6 hours, and have designated days of the week where I study for my classes (monday i study stats, tuesday psychology, saturday anthropology, etc). I also struggle with a fearful obsession of 'not studying enough' to the point where it costs me meals, sleep, and an overall life outside of my studies,  ~~plus my sanity.~~ but I am not good at school. I excel in every assignment but really messed up on midterms. I've received advice to improve my test-taking skills but during every test I've ever taken, I cry and blank out, no matter the amount of academical and mental prep I did prior. Sometimes, if I studied hard enough prior, the information I learned will retain and I let my subconscious take over, which results in me BARELY pulling through. For university though, especially STAT, I struggle a lot. I fear being put on academic probation because if it gets to that point, I'm scared of what I would do to myself because my and my family's expectations for myself as a first-gen student are extremely high, and the concept of being the best and most successful has been drilled into my head. I want to go in for a possible diagnosis and accommodations because I feel as though I have some sort of anxiety with the way I go and feel about my life regarding school, but I've been told by several of my professors and peers that it's much too late for the accommodations to take effect by the time my finals come around, so I should hold the process until next semester. So at the moment, I have to deal with it on my own, but as of late, I don't know what I am doing wrong. I review and rewrite notes, do examples, watch videos, read my textbook if applicable, everything I can think of to study well, but it doesn't work. Are there any methods that people use that seem to work wonders? And also, is it possible that outside factors can affect my studying? because my home is very cold, my hands and feet often fall asleep and the tingly pain is quite annoying, to say the least.

Hi, an international student here (arrived in August).\n\nI randomly came across a post about a stabbing incident at the University LRT station about eight months ago. I started looking more about this incident \\*big mistake\\*, and apparently, this is not uncommon in Edmonton, especially in the LRT, and security is poor.\n\nFor context, I came from Europe, and ever since I arrived, I've been feeling bad, safety-wise, about this city. I've lived in three countries, one in South America, and I've never felt this way even when I travelled alone in SA for a month.\n\nIt started when I had to go to Downtown in August to take care of some bureaucracy. Then I stopped going to the Downtown public library to study when I saw a junkie beating a librarian 10 feet away from me. But eventually, I kept feeling uncomfortable in other places, including the HUB area on campus,  and I was approached by sketchy people at least three times.

Hi everyone, I hope you are coping well with the new semester!\n\nI am a student from the University of Toronto Mississauga who is currently working on her Undergraduate Honours Thesis in Psychology, supervised by Professor Stuart Kamenetsky from the Department of Psychology. \n\nWe are currently conducting a study that examines whether overconfidence in knowledge about current issues university students face is predictive of adjustment and well-being and prosocial behaviour above and beyond demographic and dispositional factors. Our study will investigate whether social media usage amongst university students can contribute to overconfidence in knowledge about controversial current issues and whether this can impact well-being and adjustment and prosocial behaviour in university students.  The current issues that are investigated include: the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies, physical and mental health and well-being, risky behaviour, disability, climate change, indigenous issues, race issues, sexual orientation and gender diversity. The study has been approved by the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) Ethics Review Committee (Reference #: 2021-13) to ensure that there is no deception involved and this study involves only minimal risk to participants.\n\nWe are looking for undergraduate students who are currently studying in a Canadian university to complete an online survey consisting of a total of 10 questionnaires. The entire survey should take a total of 1.5 hours to complete.\n\nThe results of this study will contribute to existing research on cognitive biases in Psychology and may provide insights about the role that polarized views on current controversial issues may play in students\u2019 adjustment and well-being. All responses will be kept confidential and strictly anonymous as we are only interested in general trends in overconfidence. Any personal information obtained from the participant will be deleted after the study has been completed.\n\nThe link to the survey is provided below:\n\n[https:\/\/utorontopsych.az1.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV\\_9QtJ1DfZD5Y3bM2](https:\/\/utorontopsych.az1.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_9QtJ1DfZD5Y3bM2)\n\nIf you have any further questions, you may contact the principal investigator, Dr. Stuart Kamenetsky, at [stuart.kamenetsky@utoronto.ca](mailto:stuart.kamenetsky@utoronto.ca), or the research assistant, Xueying Huang, at [xueying.huang@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:xueying.huang@mail.utoronto.ca).\n\nThank you!","1802":"Is it worth getting a better GPA in engineering.

Right now there's a lot of people that don't feel safe on the LRT due to a larger and more aggressive homeless population, which is very understandable. However, I think that this is largely a pandemic issue and will likely resolve itself once covid-19 dies down. Nobody knows for certain when that will be, but with boosters and milder covid variants, my guess would be before Fall 2022.\n\nHere's my case:\n\n1. Covid precautions have reduced capacity in homeless shelters and other treatment facilities\/programs. This means more homeless and drug addicts sleeping rough and out in public spaces.\n2. Fewer \"normal\" transit users are around to crowd out problematic ones due to remote working. This means that the homeless and drug addicts are more visible and it's easier for aggressive ones to pick on isolated victims. Also, generally people feel safer when there's lots of watching eyes around (I know I do).\n3. Valley line Southeast will open up this summer, so starting in Fall 2022 there will be ridership from a whole new quadrant of the city. Churchill station is the transfer point to get to the university from the Valley line, so everywhere between Churchill and University should see a lot more foot traffic.\n4. A return to pre-pandemic revenue levels for ETS means that it will be easier for them to fund better security. Right now they are in a tough spot, with reduced ridership but higher costs.\nA lot of people are voicing their concerns about transit safety right now, and it's important to get that message out. But I would hate for this to turn into a death spiral for the transit system, with everyone hearing how bad it is and opting to buy a car and drive - exacerbating safety and revenue issues which turn more people away from transit (and so on).\n\nSo when we talk about how things are bad on the LRT, I hope the call to action is to push the City for better transit security and the province for more money towards shelters and mental health - not to convince students they need to take on 7-10k\/year in debt to pay for a car.","1807":"Well, see you guys after reading week, hopefully!.

I took three last semester but im only in 2 right now, and apparently taking 2 per sem is considered part time not full time.

I live alone and I gotta do all my crap, and that takes time.

With exams likely coming soon for many students, or maybe already happening for some, I thought I'd put together what I hope to be a useful resource for students (mainly in STEM fields) containing some exam and study tips that I found effective:\n\n1. **Try to be a part of a cohort**.  It could be a formal one that is part of the University, or just a go-to group of friends in your field of study that are reliable study partners.  I was shy, so I didn't really have one until my 4th semester, but studying with peers helped tremendously.\n2. **Take advantage of office hours**, be it with a prof, or a TA (that you trust and respect, some really are trash).  This can be a good place to meet peers, and may help facilitate point #1 (it did in my experience).\n3. **Get access to a useful calculation software, online resource, etc**.  The cohort I was a part of had a member with an ongoing subscription to Wolfram Alpha Pro, and the ability to go through step-by-step solutions together was a game changer during study and homework sessions.  Careful with this one!  Sharing the account between users is against the Terms of Service, but being present in the same room as someone else who happens to have a subscription, is grey-area ;).\n4. **Always go through the practice\/sample exams**, if your prof shares any.  If they don't, then check the [Exam Registry](https:\/\/www.su.ualberta.ca\/services\/infolink\/exam\/).\n5. **Always quickly skim through the exam from front to back before beginning** (or at least, skim through the most heavily weighted questions).  Flag the questions that you know how to answer, and begin with those that are worth the most points.  I can think of several physics courses I took that had exams that were \"a marathon, not a sprint\".  Many of these exams were ones that I didn't anticipate finishing in the allotted time, so instead, I prioritized the questions that I could solve or had some idea how to approach.\n6. **Do the very best you can to leave no question unanswered**, part marks can go a long way sometimes.  I've gotten a point or two on multiple exams for literally just writing down the relevant equation and doing nothing with it, or drawing a diagram correctly but solving nothing.\n7. Be it life sciences, or physical sciences, **you have to know the basics**: cycles, laws, definitions, nomenclature, etc.  Be able to explain these to a peer and\/or layperson with no difficulties or hesitation.\n8. **Always review your exam when you get your results back**.  In some cases, you may find your grade was wrong or unfair, and get some marks restored to resolve this.  In other cases, you will see precisely where you went wrong.  Making errors, and addressing them, is a key part of learning any new skill.\n9. **Re-do the problem sets and review your results there as well**.  Always go through any solution sets provided by an instructor and compare, even if you got the question correct the first time.  By comparing, you may realize there was a different and\/or faster way to approach the problem.  Practice, practice, practice.\n10. **Avoid the pre- and post-exam chatter**.  This usually just leads to unnecessary stress and anxiety.  With everything being online these days, I put this point last as it is surely less relevant.\n\nWith all of these tips in mind and with a lot of effort, sometimes one still has a bad exam.  It happens, but it's not the end of the world.  Never forget that there is always room for improvement, and it is possible to bounce back from a bad grade.\n\nAdd your own tips and useful resources in the comments if you'd like, and remember to be nice to one another in these stressful times!","1839":"is it just me, or is all this uni stress making the tide pod challenge look appealing...?. the stress is real","1840":"how many W's are too many if you want to get into grad school?. for more context: i had 2 W's during my second year and I'm in my third year now and I hate this elective I'm taking that people have said was an easy course idk its killing me but also if i drop i wont have enough credits to get the jason lang scholarship\n\nyes im aware grad school typically looks at your last 60 credits and i just hit that many credits but especially with my new medication my mental health has taken a hit and idk what to do about this class","1841":"Dear this school year,.

Hi U of A students, \n\nJust a concerned Albertan and U of Calgary student that made a petition for the choice of online school for literally the last 5 weeks of classes. Please see below for information and maybe you guys can support it as well as create one for U of A!\n\n[Link to petition](https:\/\/www.change.org\/onlineuofcwinter2022)\n\nAt U of C We already know the SU is working hard at this . There is not much in our hands, the most we can do is show our support.\n\n**Inspired from University of Lethbridge Petition:**\n\nIt would be best for students if the Winter 2022 term was formally declared to be delivered primarily online or at least provide the option for the students to do so.\n\nOn December 22nd, 2021, the University of Calgary sent an email to its students informing that the Winter 2022 semester would begin online and that in person classes would resume on January 31st, 2022. This initial email also stated that university operations would remain open in anticipation of a return to in person learning. The student body understood that the university needed time to study and observe the situation with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, however the student body expected a concrete answer to the method of course delivery by January 31st.\u00a0\n\nHowever, on January 14th, 2022, the university again sent an email, this time telling students that online learning would be extended to February 28th, 2022 in order to minimize the amount of students on campus, a respectable decision. Again, students were told that campus services would remain open. This obviously was not the concrete answer that students were hoping for, but instead was university administration kicking the can down a bit further down the road and leaving many students feeling uncertain about the future of this semester.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty caused by this decision, we respectfully request that university administration formally declare that the Fall 2022 semester will be primarily delivered online as it has been since the start of the semester.\n\nOur other request pertains to in person examinations and course components. If the university wishes to keep students and faculty safe, then they would be wise to keep the testing centre closed and have all examinations conducted online. It is unfair to make students come into a poorly ventilated room that could potentially expose them to COVID-19. In addition to this, all components of classes that CAN be taught online, should be taught online in order to protect students and faculty as much as possible.\n\nThe decision to not make a decision has left those who don't ordinarily reside in the city of Calgary or the surrounding area with even more uncertainty as assuming in person classes resume as now scheduled, those students will be coming to Calgary for only 5 weeks of in person classes and final exams, an amount of time that may not be worth the stress and cost of moving for some students. Even for those students who do reside in Calgary and the surrounding area, having a routine disrupted is not ideal and would have an effect on students overall health.\n\nFor the sake of our students and our professors, please sign this petition and share it with your friends and colleagues. Together, we can get through this virtual semester.\u00a0","1846":"Mental Health Reminder no. 1. \u201cVerily with hardship comes ease\u201d Quran 94:5-6\n\nIslam teaches us to take care of ourselves and value our state of mind, and there are many wonderful reminders in our religion to guide and motivate us.

Although the \u260524 gives enough implications, does each preceding Fall\/Winter means the most recent Fall\/Winter or ALL Fall\/Winter? \n\nAlso, due to mental health issue I performed very poorly in my first year (Fs) but over the past 2 years, I was able to maintain my GPA (mostly transferable courses) at around 3.9.

Hi everyone, I hope you are coping well with the new semester!\n\nI am a student from the University of Toronto Mississauga who is currently working on her Undergraduate Honours Thesis in Psychology, supervised by Professor Stuart Kamenetsky from the Department of Psychology.\n\nWe are currently conducting a study that examines whether overconfidence in knowledge about current issues university students face is predictive of adjustment and well-being and prosocial behaviour above and beyond demographic and dispositional factors. Our study will investigate whether social media usage amongst university students can contribute to overconfidence in knowledge about controversial current issues and whether this can impact well-being and adjustment and prosocial behaviour in university students. The current issues that are investigated include: the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health policies, physical and mental health and well-being, risky behaviour, disability, climate change, indigenous issues, race issues, sexual orientation and gender diversity. The study has been approved by the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) Ethics Review Committee (Reference #: 2021-13) to ensure that there is no deception involved and this study involves only minimal risk to participants.\n\nWe are looking for undergraduate students who are currently studying in a Canadian university to complete an online survey consisting of a total of 10 questionnaires. The entire survey should take a total of 1.5 hours to complete.\n\nThe results of this study will contribute to existing research on cognitive biases in Psychology and may provide insights about the role that polarized views on current controversial issues may play in students\u2019 adjustment and well-being. All responses will be kept confidential and strictly anonymous as we are only interested in general trends in overconfidence. Any personal information obtained from the participant will be deleted after the study has been completed.\n\nThe link to the survey is provided below:\n\n[https:\/\/utorontopsych.az1.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV\\_9QtJ1DfZD5Y3bM2](https:\/\/utorontopsych.az1.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_9QtJ1DfZD5Y3bM2)\n\nIf you have any further questions, you may contact the principal investigator, Dr. Stuart Kamenetsky, at [stuart.kamenetsky@utoronto.ca](mailto:stuart.kamenetsky@utoronto.ca), or the research assistant, Xueying Huang, at [xueying.huang@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:xueying.huang@mail.utoronto.ca).\n\nThank you!","1862":"Reminder: The Posts you see on this subreddit are driven by emotion..

I can't wait to finish this semester and be done with introductory computer science courses so I could move on to bigger and better things with larger amount of complexity. The introductory computer science courses asssignment are large in scope so they don't give me a lot of anxious because it is large enough where it is impossible for two person to have similar code unless they copied from each other. Also there is no skeleton and no well-defined functions that we have to follow so there is a lot of room for creavity and uniqueness.\n\nHowever, the lab.  They just give me a lot of annxiety because the functions are well-defined and it come with a lot skeleton code where you have to fill in the blank. I look at some of the functions and I think to myself that there are possibly 2-3 ways at almost to do each of them. I always tried to find the solution that is least to be taken by other people but sometime I just do what is the obvious and put the first solution that came to mind.\n\nIn my first semester in CMPUT 174, I saw 100+ people in the course across the university got caight into scandal of copying from online materials so I did some investigations and I found out that is has been happening for years. While I am happy that the department have implemented the lab demo section to conduct oral exam students to double check. It didn't solved the problem.\n\nMy proprosal for the department is to adpot the style in CMPUT 350 for CMPUT 174\/CMPUT 175, where during the student lab time (2.5 hours) , student must complete the lab assignment within that time frame. In the lab section, they wil have no acess to the internet, no usb, closed-book and could only use the language documents to complete the assignment.  I think that this will make the student better programmers who could think under pressure but it would make impossible for them to cheat on their assignments. Given how there are different lab sections, each lab TA could make assignments and make each lab assignment section unique.\n\nWhat do you think about?","1866":"U of Alberta Physical Therapy Interview.

This is not uncommon as we get close to mediation. We\u2019re seeing a bit more of the University\u2019s strategy, which seems perplexing and discouraging.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of where we are:\n\nThe university has posted on its web page that it is not open to negotiating a work stoppage protocol agreement with us that would continue access to all your university accounts. In the event of a strike, the AASUA would prefer to allow our members to do unpaid research to ensure that students, grants, and our and the university\u2019s reputation are not negatively impacted. We know some of you would like to do some things on campus and online here and there to reduce the damage to our careers and the university\u2019s reputation if a strike were to occur. The Employer\u2019s web page basically is stating they will move to lock us out, cutting off their nose to spite their face, to drive at their target of four more years of salary freeze (on top of two year from our previous contract). This is shocking!\n\nThis is shocking because\n\nThe public sector labour settlements we are seeing in this province in the past few months are coming in around +2.5 to +3.5% (with all benefits included) for the Alberta Union of Public Employees, The United Nurses of Alberta, Concordia University and now this week, Mount Royal University in Calgary (who this week vote on a deal that amounts to 3.25% with no concessions on any benefits whatsoever and some benefit improvements amounting to an additional 1%).\nThe University of Alberta posted at 50 million dollar budget surplus last year, and our salary increase proposals would balance that over two years. (This can be verified here on page 41).\nInflation in Canada is just shy of 5% annually and we expect the Government of Alberta to be boasting a balanced budget next week, with their coffers flush with royalties coming from high oil prices.\nIt is no longer possible to imagine that the University is prioritizing the morale or mental health of its academic staff who have toiled to keep our system running through this pandemic. The veil is off now, and we see it for what it is. This is a malicious effort to intimidate us and risks being a turning point in how all the University staff see their employer for many years to come.\n\nThe attrition in our ranks of excellent researchers leaving the university is now a dangerous avalanche that will compromise our reputation in research globally. Students are joining us in speaking out about this short-sighted union breaking posture. Setting salaries far below our comparator universities will erode education and research quality long term.\n\nIt simply is best for AASUA and the Employer to be in step with salaries across the country and province. Our mediation position is reasonable, affordable, and completely in step with other public and post-secondary institutions. Let\u2019s get a deal done and save the semester.\n\nTim Mills\n\nAASUA President","1876":"A strike is likely to happen. My teacher said negotiations broke down so a strike is most likely to happen.

A lot of her points are more geared to smaller groups and smaller changes in the ess, which may not have larger-scaling impacts but seem to be realizable. Polina, unfortunately, could not attend the candidate's forum, and this leaves this author wanting to know a bit more about what she\u2019s got planned.\n\nTahmid Al Hafiz and Chanpreet Singh :\n\nIf I were, to sum up, this platform, I\u2019d say big dreams but lacking in implementation. I really like what they want to do in terms of advocacy and the direction they want to take the ESS in, however, they could do better by providing details on how they are planning on accomplishing their goals. One point of concern is how they are going to be working together as copresidents and how they will overcome differences in opinions between themselves.\n\n### Vice President of Academics and Services\n\nAnushka Khare &amp; Ugochi Ebisike:\n\nReally passionate about their initiatives and I am a personal fan of introducing mental health Monday!\n\n**Vice President of Internal Affairs**\n\nHolly Clark &amp; Zack Dorward:\n\nSeem to know what they are doing and have a lot of experience in their past posting.

It's March again ladies and gentlemen, you all know what that means, SU election season.\n\nNow, before I launch into what is essentially a lengthy (albeit well-backed) hate post on Reddit, I'd like to preface that I wasn't always anti the SU, and I'm definitely not against faculty-student groups like ISSS or interest groups like the black students association (BSA) that don't collect fees. But, with the strike and so many concerns over excessive academic budget cuts, I feel the need to say something about the SU. \n\nI used to be an executive of various student representative groups - mostly interest groups or residence groups, and I even tried to partake in student governance by working briefly for the SU.  I did my due diligence and voted in all the elections, although my first two years I barely read any of the platforms and mostly voted on what name sounded the coolest ( as I'm sure a good 80% of us do ). \n\nMy biggest caveat with the SU is their false promises and lack of relevant knowledge and qualifications. \n\nEssentially anyone can run to be an SU executive- there are absolutely no necessities to be elected, simply being an undergrad at U of A is sufficient. This creates an environment where anyone in their second year of a business degree can decide that with what they've learned from their intro-political science classes they can fix the university. Even if they have absolutely no knowledge of how certain issues are actually affecting students. They know what the issues are, of course, they do, we all do. We all hear the catchy phrases  \"sexual violence on campus is rampant\" \" international tuition is too high\" \"minority student groups need more funding\". Note: To be clear I'm not hating on arts\/business majors, I was one. What I'm understandably upset about is that simply saying catchwords like \" I will end campus sexual violence\" or \" I will stop international student tuition increases\" does nothing to highlight how these issues affect students or what steps they'll take to do so. \n\nFor example, the issue of \"campus sexual violence\" goes beyond just saying it's a problem. What about it is an issue? How does it affect the students? Is promising to throw money at it really going to do anything, and if so WHY? \n\nHere's a real-world case: I had a friend that tried to go to the campus sexual assault center (SACE) during early covid (2020) to talk to a licensed psychologist about her sexual assault by a **FORMER UASU EXEC** (one who supposedly really cared about campus sexual violence). She simply wanted someone to talk to on a regular basis and was told that the waitlist was 8 months and that she was likely to graduate before she would be able to meet with their one and only psychologist Natasha. This is not the SACE's fault, they only had the ONE licensed sexual assault psychologist- Natasha. And before anyone says \"just go to counseling and clinical services\" she did but, because her main issue was the sexual assault she was turned away from CCS. The clinician she met with was not trained for sexual assault specifically. This was also the case when she tried to go to another campus service - Access open minds- once again the bureaucracy of the university meant anyone not specifically trained for sexual assault counseling was not able to even talk to her about the depression, anxiety, and self-hate she was experiencing. However, my friend was not discouraged, and tried to find other resources - so she attended the only available, on-campus, and free service she could find. The SACE's group therapy was 5 sessions total and 2 hours a week. But, survivors were not allowed to talk about their assault or any issues they've experienced as a result, to prevent triggering the other participants. Unfortunately, after 2 good sessions, she had a panic attack during the third and was swiftly kicked out of group for \"not being in a good mindset for it\". Of course, my friend finally disheartened and too broke to find a SA private practice clinician gave up and took the very common path of avoiding the traumatic event entirely. \n\nThis is sad but common :( Everything nowadays is held back by red tape and bureaucracy, the university is no exception. She doesn't blame the SACE or the CCS, they were simply following the rules put in place even if it means countless survivors fall through the cracks. This is where advocacy is actually needed and could help students. \n\nThis doesn't even account for the various sexual misconduct issues in the dormitories on campus (cough cough LISTER). When I lived in residence we attended one mandatory consent seminar during basecamp - but it didn't even cover the issue of sexual coercion which is on the rise in our society.  They showed us the classic \"tea as consent\" video and called it a day. Leaving many people (myself included ) to continue thinking that sexual assault has to be violent or overt to be relevant. This is because the only type of assault we're told about is when one party clearly says no or is objectively incapable of doing so like if they're passed out. But if you've ever experienced assault or harassment (which I hope to God you haven't) you'll know it's not usually that cut and dry. Often times it's confusing because the person was pressured or coerced into saying yes in one way or another, or maybe they said nothing at all, and in either case, the survivor ends up feeling like they let it happen.  I wish coercion, and technology-facilitated assault\/ harassment ( more common now than ever) were covered in that mandatory base camp seminar because at the time I truly didn't know a coerced yes wasn't really a yes. And to this day I still grapple with feeling like I allowed myself to be taken advantage of for eventually agreeing to sexual acts in residence that I didn't want. \n\nAgain THIS is the kind of thing that needs to be advocated for. \n\n And simply making kitschy tik tok-esque videos where you say you'll \"solve campus sexual violence\" with absolutely no other context or plan does nothing (not going to name names, but check the VPX candidates' Instagrams and you'll see what I'm referring to). These candidates and eventual executives know nothing of these issues beyond the catchphrases that I previously mentioned. Honestly when they say \"I will increase advocacy for minority student groups\" or \"I will put pressure on the Alberta minister of advanced education to stop international tuition increases\" what does that even mean???? What actual plans do they have???\n\nMost of the issues they claim to want to solve could be solved by simply increasing funding. This could easily be done if we got rid of the SU - each executive gets a yearly salary of 45K ( before tax deductions). Let's do the math, there are 5 execs and they get to go on countless conferences, training exercises in fun locations, and group bonding events - usually with free alcohol, giveaway gifts, and raffles ( like the YEARLY Christmas event - which is an overt and gluttonous example). To round down let's say that 225-250K a year goes to SU pay and expenses. This money could go to real issues or could even increase salaries for non-essential staff so that they wouldn't need to strike in the first place. \n\nI'm not saying UASU execs don't deserve to get paid, they do a considerable amount of work a week by just sitting quietly in meetings, but I have friends that have been past execs and even they admit that they always fall very short of their platform goals. - more so during COVID. WHICH OF COURSE THEY WOULD. The U of A doesn't actually give them power - just enough to have the pretense of student governance. So with all of this taken into account why would we even keep the mandatory SU fees? \n\nWould it not be better for the students to have the option to opt-out of SU fees, or direct the funds to other places, instead of cutting salaries for various non-essential staff with full careers that somehow make less an hour than the SU execs? And we need to take into account voter apathy, most people just don't care about university elections and wouldn't even notice if there wasn't an SU. Look at Ryerson, in 2020 their SU was no longer recognized as part of the university b\/c of several financial scandals and their university is doing just fine without them. And don't even get me started on how easy it is for financial mismanagement like what happened at Ryerson to occur. SU execs can easily use the SU credit card for personal expenses not related to student issues. For goodness sake, they complete their own audit report!!! \n\nStill not convinced? \n\n\\- [https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ryerson-university-students-union-1.5439733](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/toronto\/ryerson-university-students-union-1.5439733)\n\n**-** [**https:\/\/thegatewayonline.ca\/2016\/09\/throwback-su-funds-stripper\/**](https:\/\/thegatewayonline.ca\/2016\/09\/throwback-su-funds-stripper\/) **\\* I HIGHLY recommend giving this one a read** \n\n\\- [https:\/\/www.universityaffairs.ca\/news\/news-article\/following-a-series-of-controversies-do-student-unions-need-more-oversight\/](https:\/\/www.universityaffairs.ca\/news\/news-article\/following-a-series-of-controversies-do-student-unions-need-more-oversight\/)\n\n\\- [https:\/\/www.academica.ca\/top-ten\/controversies-student-unions-across-canada-raise-questions-oversight-transparency](https:\/\/www.academica.ca\/top-ten\/controversies-student-unions-across-canada-raise-questions-oversight-transparency)\n\n\\- [https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/3833413\/dalhousie-student-slams-anti-canadian-motion\/](https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/3833413\/dalhousie-student-slams-anti-canadian-motion\/)\n\n\\- [https:\/\/cupe.ca\/university-toronto-students-union-cuts-40-cent-their-staff-despite-student-concerns](https:\/\/cupe.ca\/university-toronto-students-union-cuts-40-cent-their-staff-despite-student-concerns)\n\n\\-[https:\/\/thevarsity.ca\/2019\/03\/31\/to-next-years-unions-less-controversy-more-engagement-please\/](https:\/\/thevarsity.ca\/2019\/03\/31\/to-next-years-unions-less-controversy-more-engagement-please\/)\n\n\\- [https:\/\/scott-d-jacobsen.medium.com\/kwantlen-polytechnic-university-continues-to-be-caught-in-controversies-in-many-areas-for-more-than-47856b49cdc2](https:\/\/scott-d-jacobsen.medium.com\/kwantlen-polytechnic-university-continues-to-be-caught-in-controversies-in-many-areas-for-more-than-47856b49cdc2)\n\n\\- [https:\/\/www.su.ualberta.ca\/about\/budgetsfees\/budgets\/](https:\/\/www.su.ualberta.ca\/about\/budgetsfees\/budgets\/)\n\nI know I'm not alone in this sentiment (especially if you read up to this point) so please if you feel the same way ( or not) let me know.","1915":"how to feel happy?.

Ever since I got a 100 in two courses back in grade 11, I have been so fixated on getting perfect marks this year too but I feel like it's tiring me out and that ultimately, I am just wasting my time. I have other things I want to spend time on too, things like music and art. I'll have to start working once I'm in uni too and god I don't even know how to drive yet. I don't even get enough sleep most of the days and I think, because of that, I have a hard time paying attention in class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to know how much you time you guys get to study and how busy you are so that I can decide for myself what I want to do about this habit of mine.","1920":"Is anyone else\u2019s classes empty today too?

Disclaimer: I am choosing to stay anon since my identity would give away the youth I spoke to. I have spoken to countless people who have worked and dealt with Haruun and have compiled this. There are no names here because a lot of them are minors or are done being associated with Haruun. \n\nHaruun Ali is known for his \u201cactivism\u201d and \u201cpolitical work\u201d in the Edmonton community. But the reality is much darker. Haruun has created unsafe spaces for youth, exploited them for their physical, emotional, and intellectual labor. He has treated blue collar workers with disrespect and humiliated them. It is time he is exposed for what he is: power and money hungry. Let me preface this, I am not someone who was involved in any capacity in his municipal or university campaign, I am however someone who works with and mentors youth, in particular minors, and knows my worth and place in the community to speak out for these youth who have confided in me. For this reason, every experience, every youth here is anonymous and protected. A lot of these youth feel voiceless and powerless, and Haruun has taken advantage of this. Below I have outlined the inexcusable and exploitative behaviour of Haruun Ali:\n\n- Haruun has not only grossly underpaid some of the youth employed in his campaign, but in fact paid them cents an hour for their work. I will not go into specifics as to protect the identifying markers of each case, but Haruun promised wages and continued to promise those wages when these individuals were asking him for payment. For some of these youth, they worked months on his campaign with no pay, thinking he would keep to his word. If he did pay them, it was only a fraction of what had been promised. He took advantage of the fact many of these youth were not only new to these spaces, but that they were minors and a lot of them did not know better that it should have been put into writing. Haruun knew he needed to pay these individuals and chose not to. They asked many times for their rightfully earned money yet they only heard excuses from Haruun. Let me make it clear, HE HAD ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THEM ALL WHAT THEY WERE PROMISED. He had a surplus in fact. But instead he rented that office which cost him thousands a month. Why? Because he was infatuated with the idea of having an office, not because he needed, but because he wanted it. After this point he told these youth he was in debt and therefore could not pay them, but this was a lie. Haruun made them feel bad for him, when he was exploiting them in reality.\n\n- It is estimated by those involved that his campaign had over 25k in donations. He underpaid the youth by thousands of dollars, so where did all the money go? No one quite knows, he has not disclosed this and it is doubtful he will, but it just goes to show that this exploitation was done consciously and was all calculated.\n- Haruun constantly created unsafe spaces for the youth in his campaign. He often engaged in screaming when confronted with anything he did not agree or like. People had to leave meetings due to his verbal and emotional abuse of others. Had this been an adult he would have been called out, but Haruun hides behind the mask of also being a youth, and uses it as an excuse for his abusive and exploitative behaviour.\n\n- Anti-Sikh racism: this information surfaced on Reddit, but only vaguely. However many people who went to high school with him know this as truth. People have personal relationships with those who were on the receiving end of this anti-Sikh racism. Haruun tried to defend himself by saying he was never racist by using his identity, but many have confirmed that he was, and may still in fact hold this anti-Sikh sentiments. He has never taken accountability for this or has apologized to the people he hurt. \n\n- The history of his entitled treatment of blue collar workers is long, and it is not a secret. Anyone who has worked with him and has watched him interact with blue collar workers knows that he will often degrade, humiliate, and in general treat them as sub-human. He preaches to stand up for the working class, for those who are struggling and more, yet treats these actual people without an ounce of respect.\n\n- Lastly, my personal experience with him has only shown me he speaks from privilege. He is a dirty politician, he degrades people, especially his competitors, to racist and sexist remarks. He is obsessed with monetizing the UASU at the cost of cutting services that serve the most vulnerable students on our campus.\nI want to make this clear. These youth had no one to turn to, they were afraid to speak out and those who tried were quickly shut down by Haruun and his followers. Let me also add that the majority of these youth were people of colour and racialized. Haruun has refused to be accountable for paying them, at some points outright refusing to pay them to their face. Those who have worked with him say he should not be allowed to work with youth, particularly minors, especially when there is money involved. Only chaos and abuse can stem from working with him. He should not have any sort of platform as it was built of exploring young people. So many people who have worked tirelessly in the community, empowering each other, should instead be receiving a platform.\n\nA direct quote from someone who worked with Haruun at some point in his political career\n        \u201cThe reality is people shouldn\u2019t really work with him in any capacity. Especially if there is money involved, he is grossly under-skilled to be running anything and he has the capacity to do a lot of damage anywhere he goes.\u201d\n\nTo Haruun: you have no excuse, no explanation for your behaviour. Your age, race, or religious affiliation does not excuse any of your actions or behaviours. You knew you were harming youth yet you continue to play the victim when in reality these youth who have no voice in the community, who are afraid to speak up, are the victims. You are a performative activist at best, and a harm to the community and youth at worst.","1931":"Enough. Stop with the Haruun Ali shit.. There were several posts here last night that aren't anymore. Look, I get it. You get it. We all get it. He's got some growing up to do. Guess what? SO DO YOU. This campaign against him has grown from informing to harassing, bordering on bullying. \n\nLeave his mental health alone lest it take a turn for the worse than it already probably has.","1932":"I'm first year engg student and I'm lost.

It\u2019s absolutely the quickest and easiest way I know of to get connected to a mental health professional suited for your needs. It\u2019s also free (covered under our student insurance plan). The process of calling the toll free number, getting connected to a practitioner, and my first session booked all happened in under a week, which is insanely fast compared to getting a referral etc. \nSteps I took: \n1. Call 1-833-628-5589 (available 24\/7). You\u2019ll be asked general questions so they can match you accordingly. Very easy, painless process, friendly easygoing staff. \n2. Wait for email from the professional you got matched with , and go from there with appointment booking!\n\nAlso this is based off my personal experience using the service, ( I\u2019m not trying to promote or anything). I just found it extremely beneficial in terms of my own mental health, and I\u2019m only a few sessions in.

Your results are shit because you aren\u2019t putting in the proper work. \n\nOkay wise ass how can I start?\n\nMost importantly it begins with cultivating the self-confidence that you CAN achieve your goals. Don\u2019t skip this step because it\u2019s the root of it all. \n\nSeriously, **most of you objectively can achieve whatever you're setting out to do**, but you've neglected your mind for far too long to the point where you now subjectively don't think you can do it. **Mind** ***is*** **everything**. \n\nWhen we\u2019re at the bottom we need to create that little spark in our mind\u2019s to get that momentum going in the proper direction, the direction we ourselves want.

If you\u2019re finding that you can\u2019t focus then download the Forest App, or any pomodoro app and use it. \n\nAll of this on top of getting organized and such, I\u2019m trying to leave out the common sense things.

If your ambitions are low, cool, I guess you can have fun laying there. Again, the rest of us will continue. \n\nIt is your responsibility and only yours to ensure the momentum continues in the right direction and there will be days where it may stall or even give a glimpse of turning, and if you haven't realized it by now, **it WILL turn if not continually readjusted**. That is where you step in aggressively and tell yourself to fuck off because there is still work to do.\n\nIf  you want to continually find your potential just to break through it and find it all over again, it\u2019s a never ending competition with who you were yesterday. Enjoy this aspect of your life, where you hear those limiting beliefs in your mind and let it know you\u2019re going to prove it different. Then go out and do it. Wake up knowing that today you're competing because I can assure you that part of your brain that wants to sit around and feel sorry for itself is going to show up ready to win, so you need to as well. \n\nI know some of you may not like the aggressiveness and so I recommended listening to this, but I'd say listen to it anyways she's great:\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/WOtSvYSnzNk](https:\/\/youtu.be\/WOtSvYSnzNk)\n\nPersonally my way works for me, and you\u2019ll find your own way to continue beating yourself.

If not keep striving, keep searching. \n\nBut never stop the inner competition as this will let you tweak your life in ways that will benefit you. You\u2019ll get to the point where you don\u2019t need anyone's help because you know exactly how you\u2019re bullshitting yourself and the work that needs to be done. \n\nWhats an easy to ensure you improve from yesterdays mistakes?\n\nPersonally, every night I open up Norton and go to my journal and answer two questions:\n\n\"How did I lose today?\" I write down the battles I lost and HOW I lost them.\n\nNext I answer, \"Proposed Solutions:\" I write down the easiest actions I can take that will help me win tomorrow.\n\nThe next morning I simply review the entry and ensure I implement the solutions. Easy, why make it so complicated. I repeat this until I'm dead.\n\nLastly, I just want to say if you\u2019re the type of person who is always trying to find \u2018balance\u2019 just quit it. Be selfish for what you want, and if people don\u2019t like that then just do what I do. Don\u2019t give a fuck. It\u2019s your life, it\u2019s your experience. **Balance literally gets you nowhere.**\n\nJust remember who you are now, or yesterday, is not what the future has to be. Create that first spark and by consistently doing the sincere work you\u2019ll have eventually created a raging fire.\n\nCrush your goals and keep chasing that next win.","1945":"Looking for a weight loss buddy!.

I have depression. Over the years, I have come to terms with it. However, I still struggle within the fast-paced environment of university where everyone is gunning for something. Stigma makes it even more confusing because I'm not supposed to talk about being depressed in public or don't feel particularly compelled to. There is overall lack of empathy and knowledge towards mental illness. Sometimes I just want to talk about being depressed because it is interesting but no. If I do talk about depression, I either get bad advice for people who don't understand or pity. Neither I find very useful. \n\nStats about mental illness are [high](https:\/\/www.who.int\/health-topics\/mental-health#tab=tab_2), so I know there are a lot of people out there like me. A problem is that we have no gathering place. I was thinking maybe it would be useful if there was some sort of mental health coalition, a way to centralize mentally ill people and we can take things into our own hands to make uni a better experience for us. We could accumulate our experiences and collective intellectual wealth. It would also maybe make things less isolating. I'm not sure if this exists already or if it will be useful in any capacity? \n\nWhat are the uni reddit thoughts on this?","1954":"Confused between CS and Computer Engineering. Hi,   \nA first-year engineer here. I want to start off by sharing my experience in engineering so far. I came into engineering expecting that it would be hard but it turned out to be way harder. I am an international student who came a day before classes started. Clueless I was to find my classes. Managed to pull through the first semester and did fairly well(3.7ish) in the fall sem. I was stressed through most of the first semester. Next comes the winter semester, the shift to online impacted my mental health. I had to go to ER a couple of times and made at least made 15 trips to UHC. I probably experienced the worst time of my life during some of the weeks. Felt extremely lonely and homesick. From being crying in my bed to having an absolute mental breakdown. I felt being pressured by my previous self(fall sem). I ended up dropping a class that is not really a pre-requisite for any of the computer engineering classes but still I will have to take it at some point in time. I really like the freedom of classes in CS and taking 5 courses which would leave time to enjoy life but I also feel like I could still do well in computer engineering. Considering my mental health which could improve over the summer, should I still stay in engineering? I have already applied for computer science.","1955":"When signing up for classes, the long break is not worth it. I thought it would be great to have a large gap between your classes to get things done, but if this term has taught me anything it's that this is not the case. It's manageable when you have lots of homework going on, but forget one thing at home and suddenly you're stuck sitting on your phone for 2 1\/2 hours until your next class starts when you could have gone home long ago. I live off-campus and by the time got home I would need to turn around and head right back anyways, forgot my study material at home and all assignments are done so I'm literally sitting here on my phone trying to look busy while bored out of my mind.","1956":"To the Young Woman who sat in SUB around 9pm with her male companion and he got up and walked away.

Please, please help","1959":"Since I'm (basically) done my Education Degree, here's everything you need to know.... This post may be long so brace yourself ... and if you don't care, then ignore it. Also, this is all my opinion and based on my experience so don't come for me.\n\n**Profs you need to take:**\n\nAnnette Rouleau (316) and Timothy Coates (303) were the best profs I have ever taken throughout my entire degree. For 211, I have heard great things about Farrah Sharrif.\n\n**Info on Classes:**\n\n\\- Take EDEL 415: You get a bursary to take it which is basically free money\n\n\\- Take a language!!! I cannot stress this enough. Most likely if you want a job in Edmonton public you will have to teach French in grades 4-6. Take French 111 and French 112 as open electives. Hela Hammami (I think that's how you spell it) is such a great prof, she makes it so easy.\n\n\\- Most EDEL classes are focused on creating lesson and unit plans. There are not many midterms or final exams.\n\n\\- EDPS 410 is a sad class. I was looking so forward to it as it talks about the laws on teaching and I obviously want to be aware of the laws and the rules because it really is serious. That didn't happen here. You are tested word for word on the textbook stuff. By that I mean you will need to search the chapter for a sentence to fill in the blank. This class was easy, but I am disappointed that I did not learn the serious stuff I needed to.\n\n\\- Your impression going into ed might be \"In my EDEL science course I'm going to learn how to teach students science and I'm going to learn the science concepts they are learning like what is photosynthesis etc. \" WRONGGGGGG. They literally teach you tips and tricks to teach students, you don't learn much in these classes.\n\n\\- Edel 325 is a great class with Kimberly. Although it is a music class, she does not force you to sing, it is your choice.\n\n\\- Do NOT take the EDEL Social Class (335 I think). Everyone complains about it. Even the prof.\n\n\\- Also, take a PAC class. Literally all you do is play sports its so fun.\n\n\\- Do NOT take ENGL 299. The class title is essay writing for education students. I went in with the impression that I was going to be learning how to teach writing essays. Nope. Its all grammar focused, and not the kind where grammarly will let you get away with. It is the dumbest.\n\n**Practicum:**\n\nWhen you enroll in the EDFX 325 seminar, they will basically scare you and stress you out and it's honestly not as stressful as they make it seem. Just be super flexible and open to doing anything. You might be stuck with a not-great IFX teacher and you just need to push through. In your AFX, take on as much responsibility as you can. I asked my mentor to let me teach all the subjects and she was open to me basically teaching a lot while still team-teaching a very few amount of subjects (as per the guidelines). This will look great on your evaluation.\n\nAlso some advice about the practicum:\n\nIt will make or break your teaching. It is where you find out if you really want to be a teacher.\n\nUse teachers pay teachers, they have lots of free resources on there.\n\nDon't waste time making these new resources when you can find them online easily.\n\nSearch up on youtube tips4teachers youtube channel, it has great classroom management techniques.\n\nAlso, if you disagree with something your mentor does, just do it. They are writing your evaluation and it is not worth getting into conflict over.\n\nAlsooooo, (mostly) everyone passes the practicum. You need to really do something wrong to fail.\n\n**References:**\n\nAsk for all your references during your IFX and AFX. It is so hard for mentors to remember who you are after you left (since most of them mentor 2-3 students a year). Although you are getting your mentor to fill out your evaluation, ask for a reference. This will speak to your character and personality and they can talk about you more personally if you built that relationship. Get the principal\/vice-principal at the school to observe one lesson at least so they can write you a reference as well. if they don't have time to observe, you can still ask for a reference (like I did) as they can still speak to your character. *\\*I know people will come for me saying they can't speak about your classroom skills so what is the point, well the teacher updates the VP and the VP interacts with you so they still have some stuff to say, plus it won't hurt to ask\\** I have heard from countless people that a reference from a VP\/P is very beneficial!!!\n\nIf you want a reference from a prof, same thing, ask immediately after the class ends. Whether you think you may use the reference or not, doesn't matter, just collect it because close to application time you don't want to be hounding people asking to write you a reference letter last minute.\n\n**Jobs during school:**\n\nIf you are the type of person who works during school, work somewhere that is kid-related. You could do daycare, after school homework help, and highly recommend becoming an Educational Assistant for EPSB!!! That looks AMAZING on your resume. or be a lunchroom supervisor, so easy!! You show up for an hour and get paid 20 bucks to watch children eat lunch.\n\nP.S. on the application, they ask you to input work experience related to teaching. They don't wanna hear about your work experience at clothing stores etc.\n\n**Volunteer:**\n\nThere is a section on the application that asks about volunteer history or community involvement. I highly recommend contacting your local school and asking if you can volunteer, even if it's as little as an hour a week. Work at after-school homework help places. Big brother big sister volunteer organization has a lot of child and youth volunteer opportunities.\n\n**Applying for teaching jobs:**\n\nApply everywhere. Apply outside of the country and at private schools, even if that is not your end goal. EPSB takes forever to reply to people since they receive hundreds of applications, so you could get a job in the meantime elsewhere.\n\nYou could work somewhere outside the country teaching English. so fun.\n\nAlso, apply before you graduate. Once you finish your second practicum, you can apply.\n\n**The reality of teaching:**\n\nEveryone always says this one phrase: You are working even after work because of prep blah blah blah. While that may be true for some teachers, it does not need to be the case. I have met teachers that spend the time before school begins to get all their booklets ready and plan each activity. You obviously don't need lesson plans for each lesson you teach but they have an idea of what they are going to teach.\n\n**Teaching certificate:**\n\nDon't forget to apply for this as the application process takes forever. I think the website is TWINS.\n\nMisc:\n\nIf you hate teaching but are basically done with your degree, there are other jobs you can get. You can work with the government on the curriculum and other stuff they do up there.\n\nA lot of other jobs also require a 4-year bachelor's degree (doesn't matter what degree), so I wouldn't recommend letting it go to waste.\n\n**Study tips:**\n\n\\- Download one note to write your notes. You can insert the slides and then write notes directly beside and everything is in one section on the one-note \"app\". \n\n\\- Don't waste time writing notes from the textbook if you are not going to be tested on it. It is such a waste of time. \n\n\\- Do not rewrite the exact notes from the profs lecture slides. Instead, add your own notes in a different colour onto the slide. Rewriting notes is a big waste of time. \n\n***Did I miss anything?***","1960":"Are part time jobs difficult?. Hey! Is it difficult to do a part time job at uAlberta?

Alright so I started engineering fall 2020 and I did bad so I was placed in Y2Q2. My 2021 fall GPA was a 1.8 and I was able to appeal a request to withdraw letter due to some family issues. In order to stay in the faculty, I'd have to get an overall GPA of 2.0 meaning that I'd at least have to get a 2.2 during this winter term but unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to. I was diagnosed with ADHD on the 4th of April and I have been taking meds. The meds help A LOT. I've done probably more studying in a week than I have the whole semester. I feel like I can actually concentrate and do my work. Unfortunately, the semester is already over and I wasn't prescribed soon enough so I wasn't able to get any help during the semester. Hence my grades aren't really recoverable. I am also planning to talk to a counselor about forming study habits and strucure my days correctly. This sounds really stupid but I was hoping to somehow stay in the faculty even though I'm probably gonna fail the Y2Q2 requirements.

I\u2019m so scared of failing I can\u2019t even think straight.","1977":"stat 151 final stress advice. my final for stats is on the 27th and i only have 1 day left to study and i don\u2019t feel ready whatsoever, i feel like i\u2019m gonna fail. i\u2019ve been grinding the last few days but i still feel like i barely know anything. i\u2019ve been watching lecture videos taking, making reference sheets to help with with my practice questions, doing practice questions, and doing them multiple times yet i still feel like i\u2019ve retained nothing. idk what to do because i\u2019ve been working really hard but i feel like i might fail this class and i can\u2019t afford to do so. i was wondering if anyone had any advice for this.","1978":"Do profs get to know why you deferred an exam?.

They refused to give me any help in first year, and i had to really push them to give them to me this year. \n\nthe lady i met with in the fall made me cry and basically just said you\u2019re on your own sorry you\u2019re stupid. which was super discouraging. I have a disorder that is very debilitating but can\u2019t physically be seen, which can be very frustrating for me to constantly argue to get what i need.\n\nmy friend who has anxiety also has accommodations and they gave her way more than what i got and the process only took a day (as apposed to my 2 years for accommodations that i don\u2019t need). and don\u2019t get me wrong, i\u2019m so glad my friend got easy access to them but i\u2019m very frustrated that i had to work so hard to get the bare minimum and other students get treated so differently.\n\n\nand to add on to it, yesterday clock work took away all my accommodations so i had to email the DEAN (AR wouldn\u2019t do anything) to get them back before my final that was less than a day away\n\nany advice?","1980":"No close friends. Is anyone else lonely? Like I have friends, but nowhere near as close with them as I was with high school friends. Guess it's just a proximity thing, the more you hangout, the closer you are, but covid has fucked that up. I didn't go to classes, so talked to no one from there. I lived on campus, but still made no close friends here. Don't get me wrong, I did meet people, but I guess they would call me a surface level friend. Like an acquaintance or something, a person they would say \"hi\" to, but nothing beyond that. Everyone has their own groups here, and the more I see people hanging out, and people in relationships, the more I feel I missed out. Never got invited to any parties or anything either. Shit. Before you say join clubs and shit, I tried that, and made some friends, but I barely even talk to them outside of the activity. I don't know how to move a relationship beyond the initial stages, like yeah I got to know this person now, but what then? Sometimes I don't even know what to talk about, so when I am hanging out with a group, I just stand there unless someone actively tries to involve me.","1981":"How do people deal with overbearing negative parents?. I'm sorry if this gets too personal, but I really need some advice on this. So in my first year of uni, I realized that living with my parents while I go through all this stress won't work out. At least in highschool, I had time to myself which would let me calm down, but now I'm busy most of the time with a part time job and studies and I couldn't handle their constant negativity. I got an apartment in September and I didn't hear or talk to them for months. It was a dream come true, and I felt much happier overall as a person. However, I got hit with COVID recently, and I began to feel mentally exhausted and guilty about not speaking to them so I decided to call up and tell them which was a huge mistake. This morning, I somehow woke up to 15 missed calls, and they came to visit. I tried to turn them away once I saw them, but no. I've had a headache for a while since I got COVID and I feel physically exhausted, yet all I heard when they came in was about how lazy I am sitting inside (its literally 9:00 am and I have covid), how horrible I look(I took a shower and I'm sink), and how I should go and get some fresh air outside when I'm literally telling them that I experience a huge headache when I'm exposed to too much light. They literally start messing around with my things, messing up an already organized closet, and my room which I was already managing in such a small space by keeping stuff on the floor since I had nowhere else to put it. They start yelling at me that I should come home, and that I've become a mess ever since I left home, and how I'm doomed to fail at whatever I do in this condition. I then start getting nagged about my diet when I literally tell them that I'm unable to eat hard food (as recommended by a doctor) so I'm drinking soups and other light warm things. They start to go off on a rant about how weak and pale I look, like seriously, I'M LITERALLY SICK, LIKE HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO LOOK? \n\nI've dealt with their bullshit for years now so I've learned to control myself, but I wanted them out of my apartment right away cause I can't handle them. I was considering going home for the summer but theres no way I want to now. Now I don't want to get things wrong. My parents do love me and have tried to provide everything they can for me up to a certain point, but the problem is that they have never ever tried to actually understand me. If you even speak to one of my relatives, all you'll hear are horrible and untrue things about me which have been spread by my parents acting as the ever sad victims of my heinous actions. As a child, they were the ones who neglected me, and never gave me attention until their teens when their lives miraculously fixed by themselves. Now that they try to force attention onto me, I can't help but feel disgusted by it. I never once got an apology, or any kind of sign of them recognizing that they've never acted like real parents. Now all I feel when they try to act as parents is whether they even have the right to do so.","1982":"For the science students. Do you work part-time?  If you do, can you manage time between your studies and a part-time job? How hard is it to handle both and how many hours do you work in a week?","1983":"Hi all, I have a few questions about some decisions I have to make going into my second year.. The first question is very specific to my degree while the second is very general.\n\n1. I nearly failed CMPUT 272, and I have heard this class is often a marker for success in further cmput courses (204) and in computing science in general. Furthermore, I am in CS honors so I have to maintain an average gpa of 3.0 between my cmput courses. Hopefully an A+ and A- in cmput 174 and 175 can average my likely D in 272 to a 3.0, but I am not sure. If I stay in honors I'm quite worried about the discrete math ahead. I felt very comfortable with all the content up to and including set theory. However, I realistically could have gotten 0 on the rest of the exam (relations and functions and counting). If anybody could provide some resources that could better help me understand discrete math, or give advice on finding success in courses like 204, 201, 291, and 229 that would be greatly appreciated.\n2. My home situation is really uncomfortable for me. During the in-person semesters I stayed in residence, as I live quite far away in Alberta. I really enjoyed it and am looking to rent a place with the same roommates next year. During the summer though, I have some difficult decisions to make. My parents are so ridiculously negative and overbearing that I believe it's taking a toll on my mental health. Every day is a struggle to avoid them as much as possible. Right now I am currently looking for a job, and have been searching for the past few days with no success so far. I will of course keep trying, but I cannot spend any time relaxing in the ways I want to as I will just get lectured and berated by my parents. Once I get a job, it will be just like last summer where I will be told to spend my free time studying or applying for scholarships or searching for a second job. This really makes me want to move out, but that would take a huge cut out of what I contribute to my tuition and my semester budget. The last resort would be covering my parent's half of tuition with student loans and accepting the increased debt that would come with them. I only have 3 years left until I can move out and begin \"real\" adulthood, but it will come at the cost of a lot of my relationships from high school and such that I have been trying hard to maintain. If anyone has been in a similar situation before, any advice on the mindset to adopt and the decisions to make would help a lot.

For some information, I filled out another deferred exam application on May 7, as I was still COVID positive and unable to attend the deferred exam.

I am still COVID positive, however, as I am not recovering fully from COVID, and because I have not even been approved for this deferred exam, I am stuck on what I can do at this point. I have tried asking my professor if it would be possible to delay the exam until I recieve approval or if I test negative, but I have heard nothing from them since. I have been stressed out and afraid this whole month because of this, and as told by a doctor, I am likely not recovering well from COVID as I have been stressing about my exams too much. \n\nI am still constantly coughing, suffering from bouts of fever and runny nose, as well as having issues staying awake because of fatigue, and just functioning normally. I have been self isolating this entire time, but I am being constantly re-infected because of my weakened immunocompromised system.

I haven't been anywhere as sick as this my whole life as far as I can remember, and I wholeheartedly believed I would recover from COVID within a few days before my finals in April. However, nothing is going according to plan in regards to my health. Anytime I step out of my house, I am being re-infected, and I am testing positive and sick in the few days after to the point I have stopped going out now but am still being re-infected.

This guide will provide an overview of first year engineering at The University of Alberta. It will cover what you should expect, what you should do, and how to succeed.\n\nI\u2019d like to mention u\/dido295 for providing inspiration for this document \u2013 you can view his guide [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/comments\/8mdvp7\/first_year_engineering_summary\/). I would also like to thank u\/Master_fing for generously providing several sections of this guide, including much of the course information. You can view his original guide [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/wiki\/guides\/engineering\/master_fing).\n\nLastly, I\u2019d like to congratulate you on getting accepted into engineering. It\u2019s a big accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself. With that out of the way, I\u2019ll begin.\n\nWhat should you expect?\n\nI won\u2019t sugar coat it. **First year is hard**, no asterisks here. You\u2019ll pour a lot of time into Engineering this year, so much so that your life will be second to academics. Additionally, the correlation between how you did in high school and how well you will do here is pretty weak. [Here\u2019s](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/05u2jot7frb31.png?auto=webp&amp;s=e836d5439d6fabb8bd229ee4730743a86dac7981) a graph \u2013 albeit quite dated, as the university does not publish this info anymore. The implications of this are that you are the master of your own destiny \u2013 your grades are a function of effort and ability \u2013 not just one. Don\u2019t take your grades for granted.\n\nIn engineering, **you are responsible for yourself**. Your instructors are not here to nag you for attendance. Professors do not take attendance (with some small exceptions; see below). Your failure is your own responsibility, and you should not expect help that you have not seeked out. You cannot procrastinate consistently and succeed, nor can you learn material last minute. If you take one thing from this guide, it is the following: **You belong here and can succeed, but you are your own greatest obstacle.**\n\n**Your First Day**\n\n1. Your first class in each course will entail them going over the syllabus - boring, but important. Additionally, your first ENCMP (Coding) class with include a demographic survey. After that, it\u2019s straight to material (with maybe a day or two of review).\n2. Speaking of notes, I strongly recommend the following setup if it is within your means: A windows laptop, ideally 13\/14\u201d with an AMD Ryzen 5\/7 or Intel i5\/i7, and 16GB of RAM. A 3:2 aspect ratio is best but not essential. Lighter is better, ideally under 3 pounds. You will need this for doing MATLAB, and it may very well last you your degree. Second, get a tablet. Apple\u2019s iPad lineup is excellent, as is the Samsung\u2019s S8(+) on sale. 2-in-1s are workable if you are on a budget, but unwieldy and are atrocious for multitasking. (Macbooks, while nice machines, often cannot run the software you need, even through Rosetta).\n\n**Miscellaneou**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Grading: Courses will have grade boundaries adjusted so that the average is \\~2.7 across all sections. This means that the professors will look at the average of the course and move the grade boundaries up\/down to meet this average. You can learn more &lt;Here&gt; Note that ENCMP may or may not follow this rule, ENGL never does, and Math courses do their own thing; 102 (Linear Algebra) is much lower, and 101 (Calculus II) can be lower.\n2. Exams: The averages on your exams will be low, generally 55-65. Remember, everything will be adjusted come the end of term. Note that only overall grades are curved, not individual exams. Also, you may not get exams back for 3 weeks (or more if it\u2019s the math department.) Be patient, they will come. Don\u2019t get mad at underpaid and overworked TAs, they do their best.\n3. Calculators: None of your math courses will permit calculators in exams. Besides trig expressions, all arithmetic will be trivial so it is not an issue. Also, buy a Ti-36X Pro. It is the best calculator you can buy for first year.\n4. Eclass: All your work will be submitted online, through Eclass. The only exceptions are exams and Chemistry labs (Archaic, much?). Eclass will also have everything else you need to be successful, including posted notes, assignment information, and your syllabus.\n5. Review: Look over trigonometry, specifically identities, special triangles, and the unit circle. Besides that, you may review at your own discretion.\n6. Lectures: All your lectures will have 100-200 people in them. I hope you like crowds!\n\n**Academic Advice**\n\n1. Office Hours exist to be used. They are essentially 1-3 hours a week where professors will answer any questions you have, as asking questions in class is generally considered to be rude.\n2. Asynchronous assignments will be 10-20% of most courses. Do not copy your friends, tempting as it may be. Why? Your assignments are on the same material as your exams. If you do not learn it now, you may not know it for the exam \u2013 which is worth 10 times as much. Attempt every problem on your own. If you do not get it, then ask for help. If a friend provides a solution, understand it. Don\u2019t mindlessly write it down and ask for clarification if you need.\n3. Chegg should not be relied upon. These kind of services are tempting, and fast, but copying from them has the same consequences as above. Do note that Chegg answers are not always right, and there can even be \u2018bait\u2019 answers placed by professors to catch cheaters. Don\u2019t do it, cheating is often an instant F and cannot be erased from your transcript.\n4. NEVER, EVER COPY WRITTEN WORK. Any typed documents you submit are compared against a database of every written assignment ever submitted, as well as what is on the internet. If you decide to go off a friend\u2019s or online resource\u2019s work, ensure that you have at least taken the time to make it your own. Or just do the work yourself.\n5. Schedules are premade for you by the faculty. They may have something of a sadistic streak, giving out the worst possible schedules they can conceive, and you will not be able to change it. Don\u2019t worry too much though - you can attend any lecture you want. How? Search the course name in google, along with \u2018ualberta\u2019. You will find a link that looks like this: [https:\/\/apps.ualberta.ca\/catalogue\/course\/math\/100](https:\/\/apps.ualberta.ca\/catalogue\/course\/math\/100). Then, take your pick of lecture and professor, and attend. Simple as that. Do note you cannot attend different lectures for PHYS 130, ENCMP 100 and ENGL 199 \u2013 these courses have different exams depending on the professor.\n6. RateMyProfessors is useful, but not gospel. Remember that people may be more likely to rate a professor if they had a very negative experience, so save your judgement for after their first lecture at least.\n7. [Textbooks](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i2n2ae3mkeq61.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d7cda47d33e3ab949e7b99d0efed267815dd4361) do not need to be bought; do not support a cartel. They are all optional (except ENGL 199\u2019s, but that\u2019s like $30 anyways). The link below is worth taking a look at for my perspective on textbooks. Textbooks are a useful tool for studying and have additional practice problems beyond what the instructors provide, as well as decent summaries of the notes.\n8. Honors math is for those with no social life and masochistic tendencies. Don\u2019t do it; your GPA will thank you. The workload is crushing and the content much more difficult.\n9. Make Friends on day 1. In your first lecture, show up 20 minutes early and talk to your neighbors. Get their number\/snap\/ig etc. Sit with them in your shared classes. First year is incredibly difficult alone, and everyone is looking to make friends in the first week. After that, it gets harder, fast.\n10. Take days off and enjoy yourself. You aren\u2019t a hermit, don\u2019t act like one, and remember your mental health is important. Good mental health requires social interaction, so have some. Go to parties if that\u2019s your thing, play sports, see your significant other.\n11. Join a club. It\u2019s a good way to make friends, including those in years above you \u2013 and who can help you with their great knowledge. It\u2019s also good on a resume and can teach you more about your interests.\n12. Do not harass women, demean them, or act as though they do not belong in Engineering. They are here to learn, not to be cat called. Women have as much of a right to be here as anyone else and are equally capable, and Engineering as a practice needs to improve. Also, please shower and wear deodorant. I have smelt enough body odor for one lifetime.  Also, ladies and enbies, there is a discord server specifically for y\u2019all \u2013 though I don\u2019t have a link for it myself.\n\n**Your Courses**\n\nI would like to acknowledge u\/Master_fing here and thank him for his generous permission to use his work. Most of the material below has been copied from his guide, with some minor modifications to keep it up to date.\n\nI would also like to mention that the weighting of assignments changes year to year, as does the exam structure. Your syllabus takes precedence over this guide; read it.\n\nI'll begin with ENCMP 100 and ENGL 199, since these two courses are the only courses that can be in either first or second semester.\n\n**\\[ENCMP 100\\] - First year engineering programming course**\n\n* In this course, you'll be learning how to program using MATLAB! You'll install MATLAB (that's the name of the programming language) and learn programming basics.\n* This course has absolute cutoffs for letter grades (i.e. you need X% overall to get Y letter grade), but may be potentially scaled up to about a 2.6 GPA average. Note that the average GPA in your section may be somewhat higher, and they (probably) won\u2019t scale it down.\n* If you have a solid understanding of programming already, you'll find the lectures rather boring, and the most challenging part for you will simply be memorizing syntax\u2014which is merely tedious.\n* If you don't know much about programming, this course will be fairly difficult. The exam will require due preparation, and has been fairly difficult. The lectures, while boring, do teach a lot \u2013 make sure to review them or do something equivalent.\n* ENCMP 100 is not consolidated. Therefore, exams may be different between sections.\n* Assignments (6 assignments, 5\/10% each, 30\/60% total) are due biweekly. Professors have the same assignments but assign different weights to them. The first 3 assignments are easy, at a few hours of time or less. The last 3 are brutal, requiring much more time.\n* Labs for ENCMP 100 are completely optional. They are help sessions where TAs (teaching assistants, most of who are masters\/PhD students) can help you with the assignments or explain concepts to you. They are useful, especially if you are stuck on one specific portion of the lab. You can ask a single question and leave right after, if you so desire.\n* Exams (Midterm, 0\/20%, and Final, 30\/40%) are all multiple choice. Unfortunately, from my experience, the exams test on the minute details of programming rather than your understanding of programming. Questions test on language-specific details that a real programmer would never memorize. To do well on the exams, you should go over the syllabus and memorize what each term does; the internet or the free textbook will help with that. Further, make sure to complete the online quizzes (5 quizzes, 2% each, 10% total) before your exams, as they are frequently repeated\/very similar to questions on the actual exam.\n* Tl;dr \u2013 if you are new to coding, take this course seriously. If you have experience, make sure to memorize syntax and the unique aspects of MATLAB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[ENGL 199\\] - First year English course**\n\n* In this course, you'll be learning basic English skills to enhance your writing. You'll learn how to write clearly and concisely, how to properly cite sources via IEEE citation, and how to write an informal and (potentially) formal report. There is no final exam for this course.\n* Unlike the rest of your university classes, your English sections will only be between 20-30 students each.\n* This course has absolute cutoffs for letter grades, but the instructor adjusts the difficulty of assessments and marking to achieve a class average that is whatever they decide appropriate.\n* Unfortunately, how well you do and what you learn in this course greatly depends on what professor you get and how competent your classmates are. You'll just have to hope you win the lottery and get an \"easy\" professor for your section.\n* ENGL 199 was the only class for which I had trouble finding the course textbook online. You may need to purchase it, but luckily, the textbook is only around $30 at the bookstore or amazon. You'll most likely need the textbook, though some profs are more\/less lenient.\n* Readings will likely be assigned before each class. You will need to judge how necessary it is to complete these readings based on your professor.\n* There may be assessments of varying weight.\n* Participation (10%) is at your professor's discretion. It may be based on attendance, ungraded assignments (completion marks) or something else. ENGL 199 is the only first year engineering course with a participation grade.\n* Presentation (10%): a short presentation in front of the class. I kind of enjoyed it, please don\u2019t flame me.\n* Library assignment (10%): you'll write an annotated bibliography to practice IEEE citation.\n* Capping exercise (30%): essentially the \"final exam\" of this class. You'll write a 1000-1200 word essay in a format of your professor\u2019s choosing. You will write on one of two topics: 1) Indigenous people\u2019s relationships to the professional or industrial side of Engineering, STEM, or education, or 2) the development of an information cycle for a major news story or event (from initial social media and\/or blog posts to evening news stories, daily newspaper articles, and\/or monthly magazine articles to later professional or academic pieces). Note that these topics may be different next year.\n* This course is boring according to everyone, albeit important for your professional career - but on the bright side, you'll never have to take another English course again if you pass. Yay?\n\n\\--\\[ First semester courses \\]--\n\n**\\[ENGG 130\\] - Engineering Mechanics\/Statics**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about statics, a branch of mechanics dedicated to the study of objects at rest. Essentially, FNet = 0.\n* This course is consolidated and curved to about a 2.6 average across all sections.\n* This course is fairly average in difficulty. While we did not learn friction due to Covid, it is rumored by the upper years to be scary and traumatizing. Keep this in mind.\n* In the first few weeks of lectures, you'll learn about two things called the dot product and cross product. Do NOT worry about understanding how they work. In fact, after the midterms, you won't touch them again until MATH 102\u2014where you'll properly learn about the dot\/cross products. In ENGG 130, just blindly trust the formulas and you'll be good to go.\n* I highly recommend looking at the Hibbeler Statics textbook. The textbook provides useful examples and you can also find the solutions manual for questions within the textbook online.\n* Online assignments (10%) are assigned weekly and based on material from the previous week or two. They are straightforward, but require understanding.\n* Labs (11 labs, 20% combined, lowest one dropped) are weekly, 2-hour-long sessions where you solve a set of problems based on material from a week or two ago. The assignment will be due a week after the lab. Attendance is optional, but I highly recommend attending as there will be TAs present to help you, and who can check your answers. Also, make friends in your lab section; the assignments are intended to be done collaboratively.\n* Exams (2 Midterms, 15% each, and Final, 40%): the ENGG 130 midterm will probably be the first exam you write at university. The midterm will feel easy and everyone will say it was easy, but the average will seem extremely low, to your surprise (my year's midterm average was 55%). Everyone thinks they aced the midterm but will be in for a rude awakening when they get the exam back. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. Study hard. The final may be a set of easy multiple-choice questions or the same format as the midterms. Ask your professors.\n* If you want to do well on the midterm and final, I can only suggest completing practice questions from the Hibbeler Statics textbook, and previous practice exams.\n* The hardest part about this course is not making any mistakes doing a long question. Be diligent and be careful.\n\n**\\[PHYS 130\\] - Wave Motion, Optics, and Sound**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about oscillations and waves\u2014light, sound, springs and more.\n* This course has a consolidated final (45%) and is curved to about a 2.6 average by section. However, the midterm (20%) is not consolidated. Do note that the material will nonetheless be similar between classes; you may be able to get away with attending a different lecture.\n* This course was the hardest of semester one, and there is a ton of information covered. There's a ton of formulas\u2014probably twenty times the number of formulas compared to Physics 20 and 30 combined. Unlike Physics 20 and 30, however, you cannot play \"formula bingo.\" If you try, you will fail.\n* I highly recommend looking at the recommended textbook, the HRW (Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday). I also recommend Roger Moore's textbook, which will contain practice problems similar to those on your actual exams.\n* Online homework (10%) is assigned weekly. It is generally numeric response, with the odd multiple choice. It will be hard. The exams will be similar. Definitely don't copy and paste answers here; a significant number of students were caught plagiarizing last semester and received varying degrees of punishment. Plagiarizing is a big no-no.\n* Labs (5 labs, 5% each, 25% total) are held biweekly. You'll have up to 3 hours to complete the experiment outlined in the laboratory manual (it is free on eclass). The first lab will be the only \"easy\" lab. Typically, you'll finish the experiment with plenty of time to spare, at which point you can leave and author your lab report. The lab reports are, sadly, extremely tedious to write and require significant effort (at least 4-6 hours to write-up a decent lab report, from my experience). You'll have 48 hours from the beginning of your lab to submit the completed lab report online. This is archaic and gross, and you should definitely gather the student body to form a protest against this practice.\n* Something I liked about this course was making your own formula sheet for the midterm and final. You will be allowed one letter-sized piece of paper, and you may put anything you wish on the one piece of paper, on both sides. I highly recommend making your own formula sheet rather than using a friend's or the ESSC\u2019s since you will be more familiar with your own formula sheet. It does also help with understanding the material.\n* I would like to say I understand almost nothing of this course. I still did well, but I feel as though there was too much material to really get in depth. Oh well.\n\n**\\[CHEM 103\\] - Introductory University Chemistry I**\n\n* In this course, you'll relearn some of the material from high school, but in much greater detail. Quantum stuff, bonding, etc.\n* This course is curved to about a 2.6 average per class. It is consolidated, i.e. everyone has the same exams. You will have two midterms (10% &amp; 20%) and a final (35%).\n* This course involved a lot of memorizations, and your performance will depend significantly on how well you understand the material. To improve your grasp of the material, I strongly recommend doing the problem sets that your professor will provide you with. They aren't for marks but are a must-do if you want to succeed in this course.\n* The laboratory component of this course (\\~12.5% labs, \\~12.5% lab exam) is straightforward. Lab sessions are biweekly, typically alternating weeks with your physics labs. You'll be given 3 hours to complete the lab outlined in the lab manual (which you must purchase from the chemistry storeroom, along with your locker, lab coat, and goggles). I found the labs alright, if a bit dishwashing-simulator esque. Unfortunately, they may not be in sync with the material in lecture. Keep this in mind.\n* Seminars are totally optional, and I never went to any. They are basically TAs sitting around to help you.\n* For each of the labs, you'll need to complete a prelab found in the lab manual q the lab begins. Make sure to staple your documents together. After you complete the experiment, you are free to go and must complete and physically hand in the completed post lab to your TA's hand-in box within 7 days. The hand-in box will be labelled with your TA's name, and the hand-in boxes are located near W2-35.\n* The final lab session is a lab exam which tests your knowledge on the labs you did. You'll need to study for the lab exam; the average is typically 50-60%.\n\n**\\[MATH 100\\] - Calculus I**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about calculus. You'll begin with limits, then move on to derivatives, the focus of this course. At the end, you'll be introduced to a dash of integration.\n* This course is consolidated and is potentially scaled to about a 2.6-2.7.\n* If you took calculus in high school, MATH 100 is that, on steroids. Like, a LOT of steroids. Don't think this course will be easy because you got 98% in high school calculus. Midterm and final averages are around 60%, even though everyone accepted into engineering probably has 90%+ in high school calculus. If you didn't take high school calculus, it's going to take you a serious effort to do well in this course.\n* Pre-Class Quizzes (\\~30 assignments, 2% total, 5 dropped). These are low weight and will cover the material in the next lecture. I suggest you do them \u2013 it is much easier to follow a lecture if you know what is going on.\n* Online homework (11 assignments, 8% total, lowest dropped) is assigned weekly. The online homework is fairly straightforward and is a good opportunity for marks in MATH 100. The online homework is assigned on Enhanced WebAssign (EWA). You will receive instructions on how to set up EWA when your classes commence.\n* Written assignments (\\~10 assignments, 10% total) are due approximately once every three weeks. Do NOT underestimate the difficulty of these written assignments. The questions look easy. They're not. Get started on them as soon as possible. They are tedious and long, but if you are capable of doing the written assignments by yourself, you're already prepared for the midterm\/final exams (the written assignment questions are typically equal to than those you'd find on the midterm\/final). Note that more preparation is still worthwhile \u2013 the assignments cannot cover every possible testable case.\n* Exams (3 Midterms, 15% each, and Final, 35%) are straightforward. Note that the exam format of this course recently changed. However, the taught content is the same. Therefore, previous exams are good practice, but only do relevant questions. These are available in eclass, but more are available on the ESSC\u2019s eclass page.  For additional practice, you can do textbook questions or go over your written assignments again.\n\nThis course was a walk in the park for me. However, the average GPA for this course is still around 2.6-2.7, so don\u2019t expect a free lunch.\n\n**\\[ENGG 100\\] - Orientation to the Engineering Profession I**\n\n* Last and definitely least of the first semester courses, we have ENGG 100, where you will learn about the engineering discipline, ethics, group work, study skills, etc. That probably sounds pretty boring. Trust me, it is. Good luck not falling asleep or skipping.\n* This course is consolidated and will likely be your largest class (\\~500 students per section). The course is a pass or fail, meaning no letter grade is assigned. This course does not affect your GPA, but if you fail, you will have to take a 300-level philosophy course sometime in the future. So: don't fail!\n* Don't feel bad if you skip this class to work on other homework\/hang out with friends\/play video games! You will miss nothing important. Proof: lectures got pretty empty near the end of the semester, and anyone still attending was on their phone\/laptop.\n* To pass the course, simply complete the given tasks stated in your syllabus by the given deadline, and double check that you have completed the tasks. If you miss anything, you won't pass the course. There are 10 assignments. I strongly recommend doing them in the first 3 weeks, before the first midterm. They don\u2019t take too long, but they aren\u2019t instant freebies either.\n* This course is low-key (actually, high-key) a waste of our money and time. Oh well, I met a super charismatic instructor. Yay!\n\n**--\\[ Second semester courses\\]--**\n\n**\\[EN PH 131\\] - Engineering Physics\/Dynamics**\n\n* In ENGG 130, you learned about statics, the study of objects at rest. In EN PH 131, you'll learn about objects in motion, a field of study known as dynamics. You'll combine very basic calculus with a strong understanding of physics. Say goodbye to FNet = 0.\n* This course is consolidated and curved to about a 2.6 average across all sections, so expect it to be moderately difficult.\n* Historically, this has been known as one of the harder courses. I personally found it easy, but many people struggled with it\u2014so be warned. Think of it as physics 20 on steroids. With some momentum from physics 30 thrown in.\n* I highly recommend using the textbooks: the Hibbeler Dynamics textbook and the HRW (Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday).\n* You'll be given 12 assignments (not for marks) as the term progresses. These assignments are great for practice and are similar to the difficulty of the exams\/seminars. Like the problem sets of Chemistry, these are very important for your success and self-evaluation.\n* Seminars (11 seminars, 10% total, lowest dropped) occur on a weekly basis. You'll be writing your seminars in a big lecture hall with the rest of your section, so more than 100 people writing with you. You're allowed to \"discuss\" problems together, but not allowed to share solutions directly (although this obviously still happens a lot). Your seminars will be based on material from the previous two weeks and will be 50 minutes long. These seminars are very difficult if you do not study throughout the semester, as they are usually comprised of questions taken directly from past final exams. Interestingly, everyone gets the same seminar regardless of the time of their seminar, though you must submit it during the seminar period. Attendance is taken.\n* Labs (5 labs, 15% total) are exactly like in PHYS 130, except they're only worth 15% of your overall grade compared to 25% in PHYS 130. They are just like the ones in PHYS 130.\n* Exams (Midterm, 30%, and Final, 45%): by now, you should be well familiar with how exams work. You'll be provided with historical exams. If you're looking for extra practice, do the assignments and do practice questions from the two course textbooks.\n* I liked this course, since it was a good blend of understanding and computation.\n\n**\\[CHEM 105\\] - Introductory University Chemistry II**\n\n* In this course, you\u2019ll cover 5 units; Kinetics (reaction rates), Equilibrium,  Coordination Chemistry, Thermochemistry, and Electrochemistry. If you did poorly in CHEM 103, don\u2019t worry; barely any material is shared. If you took AP chemistry, you'll have learned almost everything in this course already. As with CHEM 103, there will be some additional topics that vary from professor to professor.\n* Unlike CHEM 103, this course is much more about your understanding of formulas and ability to apply them; the exams will have a lot less discrete theory, and a lot more calculations.\n* This course is the same as CHEM 103 in format, besides the removal of seminars.\n\n**\\[MATH 101\\] - Calculus II**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn even more about Calculus. It has 3 broad topics; First, integration and methods of integration. Second, sequences and series, especially at infinity. Third, geometry and surfaces. Each is about a third of the course.\n* If you took AP calculus BC, you'll have learned most of the stuff for this course already. However, the difficulty will be ten times harder, so don't underestimate this course.\n* Labs (11 labs, 5% total, lowest dropped) are now mandatory. You will go to the lab room, and a TA will go through a couple questions. At the end of the period, you will do one question and submit it on eclass. The questions are not too bad, and a similar example will be done during the lab period.\n* Assignments are in two forms; weekly online numeric response questions (10 assignments; 7% total, worst dropped) and written response (11 assignments; 8% total, worst dropped).\n* The rest of the course is the same as MATH 100. It is comparable in difficulty, perhaps slightly easier if you had no calculus background going into math 100.\n\n**\\[MATH 102\\] - Linear Algebra**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about vectors, vector spaces, eigenvectors\/values, etc. You probably only know about one of those terms right now, but rest assured; you'll become familiar with them.\n* This course is consolidated and is potentially scaled to about a 2.0 across all sections.\n* I found MATH 102 is the hardest first year course. The sheer difficulty of MATH 102 is probably why the average GPA across all sections is always low\u2014the average was about 2.0 in 2018, and has only been slightly higher since.\n* Material before the midterm will be easy in comparison to material after the midterm, so try to do your best on the midterm. Material after the midterm becomes more abstract and harder to grasp.\n* Watch 3Blue1Brown's series on linear algebra. This is non-negotiable. They are incredibly helpful.\n* Labs (11 labs, 10% total, lowest dropped) require significant thought and a good understanding of the material. They\u2019re hard, but easier than the exams.\n* Online homework (12 assignments, 10% total, worst dropped) is assigned frequently on eClass. Do them right; you'll need every mark you can get in this course.\n* Written assignments (6 assignments, lowest dropped, 10% total) are difficult weekly assignments which require significant thought. I highly recommend completing these yourself, as tedious as they may be. The midterms and finals will be similar in difficulty to these assignments and these are great prep.\n* Exams (Midterm, 30%, and Final, 40%) will test your understanding of the material learned in class. Memorizing procedures to solve questions will prove unfruitful here; instead, strive for a deep understanding. The final tested almost exclusively on post-midterm content.\n* MATH 102 ended up being my lowest letter grade in first year engineering. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The exams and assignments tested my understanding of the material, rather than my ability to number crunch\/memorize procedures to solve questions. This course is brutal. Take it seriously.\n\n**\\[ENGG 160\\] - Introduction to Engineering Design, Communication, and Profession**\n\n* This course sucks.\n* It is Pass\/Fail, like ENGG 100. Unlike ENGG 100, it requires actual work\n* This course has two portions. First is individual work, consisting of readings, lectures and quizzes (10). You get 3 attempts for each quiz, and must get 80% to pass. I suggest CTRL-F on the readings as you do the quizzes.\n* For group work, you and 5 others will choose something to design from a short list. Then, you will do the work as big boy engineers do; most of your time will not actually be on designing but rather paperwork. Added realism, I suppose.\n* It is a slog and will require consistent effort and coordination. Choose your group wisely; if someone does not do their share, you have to deal with it and pick up the slack. However, they cannot pass the course without group work, so take some solace in that.\n* You will have a weekly assignment called the \u2018logbook.\u2019 Do it, and do it well, every week. You cannot pass without it.\n* I completed the course in a group of 4; 2 dead weight members dropped the course. It was not ideal, but certainly workable.\n* You will have group assignments due approximately weekly. The readings will make them easier. Keep that in mind. Also, you as a group will have to come up with times to collaborate. Don\u2019t procrastinate on this. Getting your group to meet reliably can be as difficult as the actual projects.\n* Speaking of the projects, they are not hard \u2013 just time consuming.","2012":"First Year Engineering Guide - 2022 Edition. # Introduction\n\nThis guide will provide an overview of first year engineering at Ualberta. It will cover what you should expect, what you should do, and how to succeed.\n\nI\u2019d like to mention u\/dido295 for providing inspiration for this document \u2013 you can view his guide [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/comments\/8mdvp7\/first_year_engineering_summary\/). I would also like to thank u\/Master_fing for generously providing several sections of this guide, including much of the course information. You can view his original guide [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/uAlberta\/wiki\/guides\/engineering\/master_fing).\n\nThere is something of a wall of text to read - but it will seriously give you an idea of what to expect. I read the previous iterations and it gave me a genuine idea of what to expect. \n\nGiven that I'm giving you a lot of advice here, I imagine you're wondering how I'm qualified to give advice here. All I can really provide is that a lot of my advice is similar to that of my predecessors, and that my GPA was quite high - 3.9.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to congratulate you on getting accepted into engineering. It\u2019s a big accomplishment, and you should be proud of yourself. With that out of the way, I\u2019ll begin.\n\n# What should you expect?\n\nFirst year is hard, no asterisk necessary. You\u2019ll pour a lot of time into Engineering. Your life will become second to academics. Additionally, the correlation between how you did in high school and how well you will do here is pretty weak. [Here\u2019s a graph](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/05u2jot7frb31.png?auto=webp&amp;s=e836d5439d6fabb8bd229ee4730743a86dac7981) \u2013 albeit dated, as the university does not publish this anymore. The implications of this are that you are the master of your own destiny \u2013 your grades are a function of effort and ability \u2013 not just one. Don\u2019t take them for granted.\n\nIn engineering, you are responsible for yourself. Your instructors will not nag you into their lectures. Attendance is not taken (with some small exceptions; see below). Your failure is your own responsibility, and you should not expect help that you do not seek out. You cannot procrastinate consistently and succeed. If you try, you will fail. If you take one thing from this guide, it is the following: **You belong here and can succeed, but you are your own greatest obstacle.**\n\n# Why does your GPA matter, and what even is it?\n\nYour GPA is a measure of your academic performance, **and nothing more**. In your courses, your overall percentage is converted to a letter grade\/grade points, ranging from 0 to 4. 0 corresponds to F, 2.0 to C, and 4.0 to A, with other grades spaced approximately equally between. Your GPA is simply the average of grade points \\* credit hours (hours you spend in class per week) across all the courses you take.\n\nYour GPA is important for 3 things. Firstly, and most relevantly, it allows you to enter the specific engineering discipline you desire; people with the best GPA get first choice of their disciplines. Furthermore, if your overall GPA is below 1.95, you cannot enter a discipline. If it is below 1.65, you cannot continue in engineering. You will learn more about this in ENGG 100. \n\nSecondly, it is useful for scholarships. Most scholarships have significant consideration granted to your academic performance. \n\nLastly, it's also useful for getting internships\/coops\/research placements, at least to a point. Diminishing returns certainly applies, and it won't matter for every position. \n\nRemember, your GPA is **not a measure of your worth as a person.**  You do not need a stellar GPA to be a successful engineer.\n\n# Your First Day and What to Bring\n\n1. Your first classes will consist of professors welcoming you to the faculty and going through their syllabus. Your first ENCMP (Coding) class with include a demographic survey that is worth taking a look at. After that, you're going straight to material (with maybe a day of review) \n2. Buy a Ti-36X calculator. It is the best option available. \n3. In order to be ready for your classes, you will need technology. I strongly recommend the following setup if it is within your means:\n\n* A Windows laptop, ideally 13\/14\u201d with an AMD Ryzen 5\/7 or Intel i5\/i7, and 16GB of RAM. Lighter is better, ideally under 3 pounds - you will be carrying it around all day. You will need this for doing MATLAB.  (Macbooks, while nice machines, may lack software compatibility, even through Rosetta. This is more likely in upper year courses, and basically guaranteed in Mech E\/Civ E)\n* A tablet. Apple\u2019s iPad lineup is excellent, as is the Samsung\u2019s S8(+) on sale. 2-in-1 laptops are workable if you are on a budget, but unwieldy and are poor for multitasking.\n* No paper. Seriously, paper sucks. You cannot go back to paper once you have started using digital notes. If any tablet is outside of your means, Staples sells 80 page notebooks for 10 cents.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n1. Grading: Courses will have grade boundaries adjusted so that the average is \\~2.6 across all sections. This means that the professors will move the grade boundaries to their desired distribution. Note that this does not apply to ENGL 199, which can have any average (seriously, my section had an average of 1.9; others had as much as 3.7), nor does it apply to math courses, which tend not to do much. More on this later. \n2. Curving\/Scaling: No one truly understands either of these. That being said, they are both tools used to achieve a desired class average. Curving generally entails using things like standard deviations and bell curves, whilst scaling involves moving the grade boundaries to achieve a desirable distribution. \n3. Exams: The averages on your exams will be low, generally 55-65%. Remember, everything will be adjusted come the end of term. Note that only overall grades are curved\/scaled, not individual exams. Also, you may not get exams back for 3+ weeks. Be patient, they will come - don\u2019t get mad at underpaid and overworked TAs; they do their best.\n4. Calculators: None of your math courses will permit calculators in exams. Besides trig expressions, you shouldn't have any difficulty. All other courses will permit one.\n5. Eclass: Eclass is similar in function to google classroom, albeit without the polish. All your work will be submitted here (except Chemistry labs). Eclass will also have everything else you need to be successful, including posted notes, assignment information, and your syllabus. \n6. Review: Look over trigonometry, specifically identities, special triangles, and the unit circle. Besides that, you may review at your own discretion.\n7. Lectures: All your lectures will have 100-200 people in them. I hope you like crowds!\n8. Courses: You will have 6 courses each semester. That being said, 1 course each semester (Engg 100 &amp; 160) are limited in scope and workload.\n9. Attendance: Attendance is only mandatory for the following: ENPH\/\/CHEM\/MATH\/PHYS Labs, ENPH seminars, and (potentially) ENGL classes. Everything else is at your discretion. \n\n# Academic Advice\n\n1. Take notes. Your method doesn\u2019t matter but taking notes will force you to pay attention and increase your retention. Most profs will post notes, so don\u2019t focus on making them amazing, as you can review these later.\n2. Skip with a plan. What does that mean? You need to have a time set aside to learn the material, within 7 days, through an alternate means of your choice, i.e. a YouTube video. If you are incapable of this, don\u2019t skip. Else, you **will** fall behind and have a terrible time catching up.\n3. Office Hours exist to be used. They are essentially 1-3 hours a week where professors will answer any questions you have one-on-one, as asking questions in class is rude.\n4. Take-home, untimed assignments will be 10-20% of most courses. Do not copy your friends, tempting as it may be. Why? Your assignments are on the same material as your exams. If you do not learn the solution to a problem now, you may not know it for the exam \u2013 where it is worth 20 times as much. Attempt every problem on your own. If you do not get it, then ask for help. If a friend provides a solution, understand it. Don\u2019t mindlessly write it down, and ask for clarification if you need.\n5. Chegg should not be relied upon. These kind of services are tempting, and fast, but copying from them has the same consequences as above. Chegg answers are not always right, and there can even be \u2018bait\u2019 answers placed by professors to catch cheaters. Don\u2019t do it, as cheating is often an instant F8 (failure due to cheating) and cannot be erased from your transcript.\n6. NEVER, EVER COPY WRITTEN WORK. Any typed documents you submit are compared against a database of every written assignment ever submitted, as well as what is on the internet. If you decide to go off a friend\u2019s or online resource\u2019s work, ensure that you have at least taken the time to make it your own. Or just do the work yourself.\n7. Schedules are premade for you by the faculty. They may have something of a sadistic streak, giving out the worst possible schedules they can conceive, and you will not be able to change it. Don\u2019t worry too much though - you can attend any lecture you want. How? Search the course name in google, along with \u2018ualberta\u2019. You will find a link that looks like this: [https:\/\/apps.ualberta.ca\/catalogue\/course\/math\/100](https:\/\/apps.ualberta.ca\/catalogue\/course\/math\/100). Then, take your pick of lecture and professor, and attend. Simple as that. Do note you cannot attend different lectures for PHYS 130, ENCMP 100 and ENGL 199 \u2013 these courses have different exams depending on the professor.\n8. RateMyProfessors is useful, but not gospel. Remember that people may be more likely to rate a professor if they had a very negative experience, so save your judgement for after their first lecture at least.\n9. [Textbooks](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i2n2ae3mkeq61.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d7cda47d33e3ab949e7b99d0efed267815dd4361) do not need to be bought; do not support cartels. They are all optional (except ENGL 199\u2019s, but that\u2019s like $30 anyways). That being said, textbooks are a useful tool for studying and have additional practice problems beyond what the instructors provide, as well as decent summaries of the notes - so don't be afraid to sail the high seas. I found the Math 100\/101 textbook particularily useful, as well as the ENPH + ENGG 130 books. \n10. Honors math is for those with no social life and masochistic tendencies. Don\u2019t do it; your GPA will thank you. The workload is crushing and the content much more difficult.\n11. **Make Friends on day 1**. In your first lecture, show up 20 minutes early and talk to your neighbors. Get their number\/snap\/ig etc. Sit with them in your shared classes. First year is incredibly difficult alone, and everyone is looking to make friends in the first week. After that, it gets harder, fast. **This is the most important thing you can do early.** Your friends will make doing assignments much easier and provide help when you don't understand something - which is essential.\n12. Take days off and enjoy yourself. You aren\u2019t a hermit, don\u2019t act like one, and remember your mental health is important. Good mental health requires social interaction, so have some. Go to parties if that\u2019s your thing, play sports, and see your SO.\n13. Join a club. It\u2019s a good way to make friends, including those in years above you \u2013 and who can help you with their great knowledge. It\u2019s also good on a resume and can teach you more about your interests.\n14. Please shower and wear deodorant. I have smelt enough body odor for one lifetime. Hygiene is important. \n15. Ladies and enbies, there is a discord server specifically for y\u2019all \u2013 though I don\u2019t have a link for it myself.\n\n# Your Courses\n\nI would like to acknowledge u\/Master_fing here and thank him for his generous permission to use his work. Much of the material below has been copied from his guide, with some minor modifications to keep it up to date.\n\nI would also like to mention that the weighting of assignments changes year to year, as does the exam structure. Your syllabus takes precedence over this guide; read it.\n\nI'll begin with ENCMP 100 and ENGL 199, since these two courses are the only courses that can be in either first or second semester.\n\n**\\[ENCMP 100\\] - First year engineering programming course**\n\n* In this course, you'll be learning how to program using MATLAB! You'll install MATLAB (that's the name of the programming language) and learn programming basics.\n* This course has absolute cutoffs for letter grades (i.e. you need X% overall to get Y letter grade), but may be potentially scaled up to about a 2.6 GPA average. Note that the average GPA in your section may be somewhat higher, and they won\u2019t scale it down.\n* If you have a solid understanding of programming already, you'll find the lectures rather boring, and the most challenging part for you will simply be memorizing syntax\u2014which is merely tedious.\n* If you don't know much about programming, this course will be fairly difficult. The exam will require due preparation, and has been fairly difficult. The lectures, while boring, do teach a lot \u2013 make sure to review them or do something equivalent.\n* ENCMP 100 is not consolidated. Therefore, exams may be different between sections.\n* Assignments (6 assignments, 5\/10% each, 30\/60% total) are due biweekly. Professors have the same assignments but assign different weights to them. The first 3 assignments are easy, at a few hours of time or less. The last 3 are brutal, requiring much more time.\n* Labs for ENCMP 100 are completely optional. They are help sessions where TAs (teaching assistants, most of who are masters\/PhD students) can help you with the assignments or explain concepts to you. They are useful, especially if you are stuck on one specific portion of the lab. You can ask a single question and leave right after, if you so desire.\n* Exams (Midterm, 0\/20%, and Final, 30\/40%) are all multiple choice. Unfortunately, from my experience, the exams test on the minute details of programming rather than your understanding of programming. Questions test on language-specific details that a real programmer would never memorize. To do well on the exams, you should go over the syllabus and memorize what each term does; the internet or the free textbook will help with that. Further, make sure to complete the online quizzes (5 quizzes, 2% each, 10% total) before your exams, as they are frequently repeated\/very similar to questions on the actual exam.\n* Tl;dr \u2013 if you are new to coding, take this course seriously. If you have experience, make sure to memorize syntax and the unique aspects of MATLAB.\n\n**\\[ENGL 199\\] - First year English course**\n\n* In this course, you'll be learning basic English skills to enhance your writing. You'll learn how to write clearly and concisely, how to properly cite sources via IEEE citation, and how to write an informal and (potentially) formal report. There is no final exam for this course.\n* Unlike the rest of your university classes, your English sections will only be between 20-30 students each.\n* This course has absolute cutoffs for letter grades, but the instructor adjusts the difficulty of assessments and marking to achieve a class average that is whatever they decide appropriate.\n* Unfortunately, how well you do and what you learn in this course greatly depends on what professor you get and how competent your classmates are. You'll just have to hope you win the lottery and get an \"easy\" professor for your section.\n* ENGL 199 was the only class for which I had trouble finding the course textbook online. You may need to purchase it, but luckily, the textbook is only around $30 at the bookstore or amazon. You'll most likely need the textbook, though some profs are lenient.\n* Readings will likely be assigned before each class. You will need to judge how necessary it is to complete these readings based on your professor.\n* There may be assessments of varying weight and content.\n* Participation (10%) is at your professor's discretion. It may be based on attendance, ungraded assignments (completion marks) or something else. ENGL 199 is the only first year engineering course with a participation grade.\n* Presentation (10%): a short presentation in front of the class. I kind of enjoyed it, please don\u2019t flame me.\n* Library assignment (10%): you'll write an annotated bibliography to practice IEEE citation.\n* Capping exercise (30%): essentially the \"final exam\" of this class. You'll write a 1000-1200 word essay in a format of your professor\u2019s choosing. You will write on one of two topics: 1) Indigenous people\u2019s relationships to the professional or industrial side of Engineering, STEM, or education, or 2) the development of an information cycle for a major news story or event (from initial social media and\/or blog posts to evening news stories, daily newspaper articles, and\/or monthly magazine articles to later professional or academic pieces). Note that these topics may be different next year.\n* This course is boring according to everyone - but on the bright side, you'll never have to take another English course again if you pass. Yay?\n\n***--\\[ First semester courses \\]--***\n\n**\\[ENGG 130\\] - Engineering Statics**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about statics, a branch of mechanics dedicated to the study of objects at rest. Essentially, FNet = 0.\n* This course is consolidated and curved to about a 2.6 average across all sections.\n* This course is fairly average in difficulty. While we did not learn friction due to Covid, it is rumored by the upper years to be scary and traumatizing. Keep this in mind.\n* In the first few weeks of lectures, you'll learn about two things called the dot product and cross product. Do NOT worry about understanding how they work. In fact, after the midterms, you won't touch them again until MATH 102\u2014where you'll properly learn about the dot\/cross products. In ENGG 130, just blindly trust the formulas and you'll be good to go.\n* I highly recommend looking at the Hibbeler Statics textbook. The textbook provides useful examples and you can also find the solutions manual for questions within the textbook online.\n* Online assignments (10%) are assigned weekly and based on material from the previous week or two. They are straightforward, but require understanding.\n* Labs (11 labs, 20% combined, lowest one dropped) are weekly, 2-hour-long sessions where you solve a set of problems based on material from a week or two ago. The assignment will be due a week after the lab. Attendance is optional, but I highly recommend attending as there will be TAs present to help you, and who can check your answers. Also, make friends in your lab section; the assignments are intended to be done collaboratively.\n* Exams (2 Midterms, 15% each, and Final, 40%): the ENGG 130 midterm will probably be the first exam you write at university. The midterm will feel easy and everyone will say it was easy, but the average will seem extremely low, to your surprise (my year's midterm average was 55%). Everyone thinks they aced the midterm but will be in for a rude awakening when they get the exam back. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. Study hard. The exams will be 3-5 long answer questions.\n* If you want to do well on the midterm and final, I can only suggest completing practice questions from the Hibbeler Statics textbook, and previous practice exams.\n* The hardest part about this course is not making any mistakes doing a long question. Be diligent and be careful.\n\n**\\[PHYS 130\\] - Wave Motion, Optics, and Sound**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about oscillations and waves\u2014light, sound, springs and more.\n* This course has a consolidated final (45%) and is curved to about a 2.6 average by section. However, the midterm (20%) is not consolidated. Do note that the material will nonetheless be similar between classes; you may be able to get away with attending a different lecture.\n* This course was the hardest of semester one, and there is a ton of information covered. There's a ton of formulas\u2014probably twenty times the number of formulas compared to Physics 20 and 30 combined. Unlike Physics 20 and 30, however, you cannot play \"formula bingo.\" If you try, you will fail.\n* I highly recommend looking at the recommended textbook, the HRW (Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday). I also recommend Roger Moore's textbook, which will contain practice problems similar to those on your actual exams.\n* Online homework (10%) is assigned weekly. It is generally numeric response, with the odd multiple choice. It will be hard. The exams will be similar. Definitely don't copy and paste answers here; a significant number of students were caught plagiarizing last semester and received varying degrees of punishment. Plagiarizing is a big no-no.\n* Labs (5 labs, 5% each, 25% total) are held biweekly. You'll have up to 3 hours to complete the experiment outlined in the laboratory manual (it is free on eclass). The first lab will be the only \"easy\" lab. Typically, you'll finish the experiment with plenty of time to spare, at which point you can leave and author your lab report. The lab reports are, sadly, extremely tedious to write and require significant effort (at least 4-6 hours to write-up a decent lab report, from my experience). You'll have 48 hours from the beginning of your lab to submit the completed lab report online. This is archaic and gross, and you should definitely gather the student body to form a protest against this practice.\n* Something I liked about this course was making your own formula sheet for the midterm and final. You will write whatever you want on both sides of any standard sheet of paper. I highly recommend making your own formula sheet rather than using a friend's or the ESSC\u2019s since you will be more familiar with your own formula sheet. It does also help with understanding the material.\n* I would like to say I understood very little of the material. I still did well, but I feel as though there was too much material to really get in depth. Oh well.\n\n**\\[CHEM 103\\] - Introductory University Chemistry I**\n\n* In this course, you'll relearn some of the material from high school, but in much greater detail. Quantum stuff, bonding, etc.\n* This course is curved to about a 2.6 average per class. It is consolidated, i.e. everyone has the same exams. You will have two midterms (10% &amp; 20%) and a final (35%).\n* This course involved a lot of memorizations, and your performance will depend significantly on how well you understand the material. To improve your grasp of the material, I strongly recommend doing the problem sets that your professor will provide you with. They aren't for marks but are a must-do if you want to succeed in this course.\n* The laboratory component of this course (\\~12.5% labs, \\~12.5% lab exam) is straightforward. Lab sessions are biweekly, typically alternating weeks with your physics labs. You'll be given 3 hours to complete the lab outlined in the lab manual (which you must purchase from the chemistry storeroom, along with your locker, lab coat, and goggles). I found the labs alright, if a bit dishwashing-simulator esque. Unfortunately, they may not be in sync with the material in lecture. Keep this in mind.\n* Seminars are totally optional, and I never went to any. They are basically office hours with TAs.\n* For each of the labs, you'll need to complete a prelab found in the lab manual before the lab begins. Make sure to staple your papers together. After you complete the experiment, you are free to go and must complete and physically hand in the completed post-lab to your TA's hand-in box within 7 days. The hand-in box will be labelled with your TA's name, and the hand-in boxes are located near W2-35.\n* The final lab session is a lab exam which tests your knowledge on the labs you did. You'll need to study for the lab exam; the average is typically 50-60%.\n\n**\\[MATH 100\\] - Calculus I**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about calculus. You'll begin with limits, then move on to derivatives, the focus of this course. At the end, you'll be introduced to a dash of integration.\n* This course is consolidated and is potentially scaled to about a 2.6.\n* If you took calculus in high school, MATH 100 is that, on steroids. Like, a LOT of steroids. Don't think this course will be easy because you got 98% in high school calculus. Midterm and final averages are around 60%, even though everyone accepted into engineering probably has 90%+ in high school calculus. If you didn't take high school calculus, it's going to take you a serious effort to do well in this course.\n* Pre-Class Quizzes (\\~30 assignments, 2% total, 5 dropped). These are low weight and will cover the material in the next lecture. I suggest you do them \u2013 it is much easier to follow a lecture if you know what is going on.\n* Labs (11 labs, 0% total) are basically just extensions of lectures. They may or may not be beneficial. Note this is unique to math 100, and may change for your year. \n* Online homework (11 assignments, 8% total, lowest dropped) is assigned weekly. The online homework is fairly straightforward and is a good opportunity for marks in MATH 100. \n* Written assignments (\\~10 assignments, 10% total) are due approximately once every three weeks. Get started on them as soon as possible. They are tedious and long, but if you are capable of doing the written assignments by yourself, you're already prepared for the midterm\/final exams (the written assignment questions are typically equal to than those you'd find on the midterm\/final). Note that more preparation is still worthwhile \u2013 the assignments cannot cover every possible testable case.\n* Exams (3 Midterms, 15% each, and Final, 35%) are straightforward. Note that the exam format of this course recently changed. However, the taught content is the same. Therefore, previous exams are good practice, but only do relevant questions. These are available in eclass, but more are available on the ESSC\u2019s eclass page. \n\n**\\[ENGG 100\\] - Orientation to the Engineering Profession I**\n\n* Last and definitely least of the first semester courses, we have ENGG 100, where you will learn about the engineering discipline, ethics, group work, study skills, etc. That probably sounds pretty boring. Trust me, it is. Good luck not falling asleep or skipping.\n* This course is consolidated. The course is a pass or fail, meaning no letter grade is assigned. This course does not affect your GPA, but if you fail, you will have to take a 300-level philosophy course sometime in the future. So: don't fail!\n* Don't feel bad if you skip this class to work on other homework\/hang out with friends\/play video games! You will miss nothing important. Proof: lectures got pretty empty near the end of the semester, and anyone still attending was on their phone\/laptop.\n* To pass the course, simply complete the given tasks stated in your syllabus by the given deadline, and double check that you have completed the tasks. If you miss anything, you won't pass the course. There are 10 assignments. I strongly recommend doing them in the first 3 weeks, before the first midterm. They don\u2019t take too long, but they aren\u2019t instant freebies either.\n* This course is low-key (actually, high-key) a waste of our money and time. Oh well, I met a super charismatic instructor. Yay!\n\n***--\\[ Second semester courses\\]--***\n\n**\\[EN PH 131\\] - Engineering Physics\/Dynamics**\n\n* In EN PH 131, you'll learn about objects in motion, a field of study known as dynamics. You'll combine very basic calculus with a strong understanding of physics. Say goodbye to Fnet = 0.\n* This course is consolidated and curved to about a 2.6 average across all sections.\n* Think of this course as Physics 20 on steroids. With some momentum from Physics 30 thrown in. And more steroids.\n* I highly recommend using the Hibbeler Dynamics textbook.\n* You'll be given 12 assignments (not for marks) as the term progresses. These assignments are great for practice and are similar to the difficulty of the exams\/seminars. Like the problem sets of Chemistry, these are very important for your success and self-evaluation.\n* Seminars (11 seminars, 10% total, lowest dropped) occur on a weekly basis. You'll be writing your seminars in a big lecture hall with the rest of your section, so more than 100 people writing with you. You're allowed to \"discuss\" problems together, but not allowed to share solutions directly (although this obviously still happens a lot). Your seminars will be based on material from the previous two weeks and will be 50 minutes long. These seminars are very difficult if you do not study throughout the semester, as they are usually comprised of questions taken directly from past final exams. Interestingly, everyone gets the same seminar regardless of the time of their seminar, though you must submit it during the seminar period. Attendance is taken.\n* Labs (5 labs, 15% total) are exactly like in PHYS 130, except they're only worth 15% of your overall grade compared to 25% in PHYS 130. They are just like the ones in PHYS 130.\n* Exams (Midterm, 30%, and Final, 45%): by now, you should be well familiar with how exams work. You'll be provided with historical exams. If you're looking for extra practice, do the assignments and do practice questions from the two course textbooks.\n* I liked this course, since it was a good blend of understanding and computation.\n\n**\\[CHEM 105\\] - Introductory University Chemistry II**\n\n* In this course, you\u2019ll cover 5 units; Kinetics (reaction rates), Equilibrium,  Coordination Chemistry, Thermochemistry, and Electrochemistry. If you did poorly in CHEM 103, don\u2019t worry; barely any material is shared. If you took AP chemistry, you'll have learned almost everything in this course already. As with CHEM 103, there will be some additional topics that vary from professor to professor.\n* Unlike CHEM 103, this course is much more about your understanding of formulas and ability to apply them; the exams will have a lot less discrete theory, and a lot more calculations.\n* This course is the same as CHEM 103 in format, besides the removal of seminars.\n\n**\\[MATH 101\\] - Calculus II**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn even more about Calculus. It has 3 broad topics; First, integration and methods of integration. Second, sequences and series, especially at infinity. Third, geometry and surfaces. Each is about a third of the course.\n* If you took AP calculus BC, you'll have learned most of the stuff for this course already. However, the difficulty will be ten times harder, so don't underestimate this course.\n* Labs (11 labs, 5% total, lowest dropped) are now mandatory. You will go to the lab room, and a TA will go through a couple questions. At the end of the period, you will do one question and submit it on eclass. The questions are not too bad, and a similar example will be done during the lab period.\n* Assignments are in two forms; weekly online numeric response questions (10 assignments; 7% total, worst dropped) and written response (11 assignments; 8% total, worst dropped).\n* The rest of the course is the same as MATH 100. It is comparable in difficulty, perhaps slightly easier if you had no calculus background going into math 100.\n\n**\\[MATH 102\\] - Linear Algebra**\n\n* In this course, you'll learn about matricies, vectors, vector spaces, eigenvectors\/values, etc.\n* This course is consolidated and is potentially scaled to the low 2's.\n* MATH 102 is the hardest first year course. The sheer difficulty of MATH 102 is probably why the average GPA across all sections is always low\u2014the average was about 2.0 in 2018, and has only been slightly higher since.\n* Material before the midterm will be easy in comparison to material after, so ensure you do well on the midterm.\n* Watch 3Blue1Brown's series on linear algebra. This is a **must.**\n* Labs (11 labs, 10% total, lowest dropped) require significant thought and a good understanding of the material. They\u2019re easier than the exams.\n* Online homework (12 assignments, 10% total, worst 2 dropped) is assigned frequently on eClass. Do them right; you'll need every mark you can get in this course.\n* Written assignments (6 assignments, lowest dropped, 10% total) are difficult weekly assignments which require significant thought. The midterms and finals will be similar in difficulty and content to these assignments.\n* Exams (Midterm, 30%, and Final, 40%) will test your understanding of the material learned in class. Memorizing procedures to solve questions will prove unfruitful here; instead, strive for a deep understanding. The final tests almost exclusively on post-midterm content.\n* MATH 102 ended up being my lowest letter grade in first year engineering. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The exams and assignments tested my understanding of the material, rather than my ability to number crunch\/memorize procedures to solve questions. This course is brutal. Take it seriously.\n\n**\\[ENGG 160\\] - Introduction to Engineering Design, Communication, and Profession**\n\n* This course sucks.\n* It is Pass\/Fail, like ENGG 100. Unlike ENGG 100, it requires actual work. Like ENGG 100, it does not count towards your GPA. \n* This course has two portions. First is individual work, consisting of readings, lectures and quizzes (10). You get 3 attempts for each quiz, and must get 80% to pass. I suggest CTRL-F on the readings as you do the quizzes.\n* For group work, you and 5 others will choose something to design from a short list. Then, you will do the work as big boy engineers do; most of your time will not actually be on design but rather paperwork. Added realism, I suppose.\n* It is a slog and will require consistent effort and coordination. Choose your group wisely; if someone does not do their share, you have to deal with it and pick up the slack. However, they cannot pass the course without group work, so take some solace in that.\n* You will have a weekly assignment called the \u2018logbook.\u2019 Do it, and do it well, every week. You cannot pass without it. Many people fail because of this. \n* I completed the course in a group of 4; 2 dead weight members dropped the course. It was not ideal.\n* You will have group assignments due approximately weekly. The readings will make them easier. Keep that in mind. Also, you as a group will have to come up with times to collaborate. Don\u2019t procrastinate on this. Getting your group to meet reliably can be as difficult as the actual projects.\n* Speaking of the projects, they are not hard \u2013 just time consuming.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat concludes the first year guide. If you're a current second year, feel free to message me with any improvments, or if you're an incoming student, please let me know if you think anything is missing or unclear. Good luck!","2013":"A Little Motivation. Hi! I wanted to create this post for anyone who needs it. \n\nThis year has been rough. I just got diagnosed with adhd and started meds so my life is starting to get better, but my grades suffered this year from it. Things turned around, but during this year I had very, very low times. \n\nI just wanted to remind everyone to never, ever give up. When you're feeling down, it affects your entire day, week, month, etc. Sometimes it is so bad it feels like it's going to continue forever and that there's no way that things could change. You have to let go and let life take its course, life will always have unexpected turns and twists that you could've never imagined. \n\nIf no one told you recently, I'd like to say that I love you. You deserve to be here and be happy. Everyone deserves this (unless you're someone who harms others lol). \n\nSpeaking like this is easy when you're doing alright, but again never ever forget this no matter where in life you are. I need to be reminded of this occasionally too. When you're not working towards yourself, your happiness, when you don't realize your worth and\/or respect yourself, no grade or job or opportunity is valuable. You come to this life, in this manner, once. Congratulate yourself for every seemingly small victory and try not to beat yourself up about failure.\n\n I don't even know if I'll be able to continue in engineering, but I'm calm because I know it'll work out in the end. There's always an alternative path, timeline, etc. \n\nHope that helped, now that I think about it I kind of wrote this for myself, but I hope it helps anyone out.","2014":"From being RTW twice to getting accepted into a competitive professional program. Hey everyone, Happy Thursday! I wanted to take the time out today to share my story, hoping that it will\/might help people that are in the same position and predicament where I was 3 years ago.\nI had originally joined the U of A as an open studies student in the Winter 2017 semester (they didn\u2019t offer intakes for any other programs for the winter semester, so I did not have a choice besides taking open studies). I was limited to only taking 2 courses, so I was still struggling how to manage because I did not have the work ethic, discipline, and organizational habits it took to succeed in post-secondary. Also being new to post-secondary, I had always been fascinated by the idea of going out with friends and only partying, and clubbing. That was where my focus was centered, so I was placed on an academic probation following the winter semester as I had only managed to sit at a 1.9 GPA.\nI had applied to the Faculty of Arts for the Psychology Major, and surprisingly, despite having a below par GPA of 1.9, I was still accepted into the BA in Psychology program for the Fall 2017 semester. I was happy that I was provided with a remedial opportunity to pick myself back up, and work on my habits to ensure I bring up GPA over a 2.0 and sustain\/succeed in post-secondary journey again. Although that was my plan, it did not pan out the way I had intended. Not only was I struggling due to my poor self-discipline and organizational habits, but I was also distracted pursuing a relationship that eventually turned out to be an abusive one, so that made my situation much worse for me, and I failed to maintain the GPA above a 2.0 following the Fall 2017 and Winter 2018 semester, and I was required to withdraw from the Faculty of Arts, and that I could return in a year with the conditions (taking\u00a0 courses at another institution and transferring to the U of A with an above par GPA).\nIt was probably about time for me to use that year to reflect upon my life circumstances and develop necessary skills and habits before returning to academia again; however, I was in denial at the time, and still thought I could do better if I tried hard. I went back to open studies again for the Fall 2018-Winter 2019 semesters and was still struggling due to the same reasons. I also went through some traumatic experiences in my relationships that took a toll on my mental health, so I was required to withdraw the second time from the open studies program as well, and it was made clear to me in the RTW letter that I could not return to post-secondary for another at least 3 years.\nI was devastated at that point, and I was in the dust in every aspect of my life, mentally, emotionally, relationships wise, financially, physically, literally in every aspect possible. My relationship with my parents was going downhill, so much so that I was very close to being disowned, and I was progressively depressed every day. I was screamed at and made feel like a loser every single day at home, so I decided to work instead to get away from the toxic home environment. After applying to over 50 places, finally an agency responded to my application, and recruited me.\u00a0 This agency was a non-profit that served people with disabilities and mental illnesses. After working there for a couple of months, I became exposed to social work as my peers and supervisors had a social work background.\nAfter doing some research into the field, I realized that this is something I envisioned myself doing because all the volunteer\/work experiences I had accumulated until then were relevant to social work, and I could build on them. This time around before returning to academia again, I reflected on my organizational habits, mental health, self-discipline, and sought therapy to recuperate. I was accepted into the Social Work Diploma Program at a community college. This was only possible due to my decision to begin working at non-profits. Working at that agency provided me with more exposure, and I actually loved and enjoyed working there, and serving vulnerable people. I worked my ass off there and paid my students off that I had accumulated when I was at the U of A, and also bought 2 cars for myself (sold one at this point). I also got a promotion into a supervisory role there. All these accomplishments only made me more capable and committed to reaching a better version of myself every day.\nI eventually expanded my professional commitments and started working for 2 other non-profits while working full-time at that agency and was also pursuing the diploma in a full-time capacity. I still wonder how I did it and managed to work 3 jobs while in school and thrive in all my commitments because I was kicked out of the U of A where I was only taking 2 courses and it was hard for me to manage that easy load. It took me 3 years to complete the diploma program, and I just graduated last week with a GPA of 3.9. I do not wish to just stop at the diploma, and also desire to pursue further education in Social Work, so I had applied to the BSW program at the University of Calgary. It is a very competitive program to be accepted into just like any professional program where they take into account all your past work\/volunteer experiences, academic history, grades, references, everything. Earlier this week, I also learned that I have been accepted to the BSW program.\nI cannot believe my acceptance because I was in the dust exactly 3 years, picking up all the broken pieces of myself, and wondering how I would move forward in life. My relationship with my parents has gotten significantly better, and they are proud of me, and now understand the situation I was in 3 years ago, and overall, life is great and beautiful now.\nMy word of wisdom to anyone that was RTW this year, and is struggling academically right now, please know that your grades do not define you.\u00a0 If you know that you are struggling, please take some time, and reflect on your life circumstances before returning to academia and ask for help because that does not make you weak. Lastly, get out there, and find a job. Work, and acquire those necessary skills needed for you to succeed in life that are also transferable and applicable to other elements of life. And please do not worry about other people, even your parents. Your focus should be you, and only you. People will come around once they see that you are doing better.\n\nEnough of my rant now! Have a good day all :)","2015":"how bad does NC for WKEXP courses look to grad schools?. im currently undergoing a sip and my mental health has been deteriorating to the point where I'm su\\*cidal again cuz of everything that goes on at work and the environment. i feel like a complete failure that i already felt this way not even a month into it and idk how long i can keep this up for before i end up hurting myself. i really don't know what to do because its gonna show up on my transcript and idk how badly that will look to grad schools. I've been feeling super numb and like a zombie and i dont think that will translate well to my work. am i really this weak?","2016":"Is it worth being a TA in grad school?. Current\/past grad students, do you recommend working as a TA during your studies? I\u2019m starting my course-based M.Ed. this fall and am wondering whether this is something I should do, or if the additional hours of work (up to 12\/week) will just end up causing too much stress and burnout. The money would be very nice to have but not absolutely necessary and I\u2019m trying to prioritize my mental health since I know the coursework alone will be a lot of work. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated!","2017":"Dropped a class today for health reasons but regret it. Is there anything I can do?. TL;DR: I dropped a class because I got very sick and missed deadlines this week but I regret not explaining to the prof. I read that you can contact a department to reverse a withdrawal if you explain but I feel like I\u2019ve got myself into a huge anxiety-fuelled mess now.\n\n-\n\nI was enrolled in two spring classes but I got very sick this past week and missed both an assignment deadline, as well as the midterm for one of them. \n\nI\u2019ve been sick (and isolating) this week but it\u2019s been a pretty mild cold until the past few days  when it hit me HARD. I could barely eat or get out of bed and have been in a mental fog. Basically all I\u2019ve been doing for the past four days is trying to sleep off a fever and constant headache, and coughing up my lungs until today when I feel somewhat functional again.\n\nWhen I missed the assignment deadline, I thought I would take the penalty and submit it late because I wasn\u2019t feeling well enough to research and write a paper (admittedly my fault for not starting earlier) but I didn\u2019t expect the sickness to escalate like this.\n\nAs I got more sick, I started panicking about what to do for the midterm (which was yesterday) and kept going back and forth on asking for a deferral or dropping the course if I was too sick to complete the coursework.\n\nI wanted to email my professor before the exam to explain everything and ask for a deferral + let him know that I still intend to submit the paper as soon as I can. But I stupidly decided to wait because the syllabus said you have to miss the exam first (apparently this isn\u2019t true for midterms?) and I wasn\u2019t sure if my condition counted as incapacitating illness without documentation.\n\nI took two rapid tests for covid but tested negative on both and haven\u2019t been to a doctor because (1) I don\u2019t want to spread whatever it is and (2) I didn\u2019t have the energy even if I wanted to. The closest thing I have to documentation is an email I sent the prof for my other class to explain that I\u2019m sick and can\u2019t make a mandatory in-person participation activity.\n\nAt this point, my anxiety got the best of me because I was worried my professor would think I was irresponsible and lying. So I decided I have massively fucked up by not submitting that paper on time and I am not worthy to ask for a deferral so my only option is to drop the class because my prof will be disappointed and hate me. It sounds irrational because I was\/am sick but the overthinking from anxiety just took over. \u2018:)\n\nI woke up today feeling slightly better and decided to drop it before I miss the deadline so I can stop stressing and making my health worse - but I\u2019ve been regretting it ever since. Mostly, I feel stupid that I didn\u2019t try to explain because I probably could have toughed it out if the prof was understanding.\n\nAnd now, my prof suddenly emailed me to ask if I ever submitted the assignment because he couldn\u2019t find it so I\u2019m assuming the drop hasn\u2019t gone though on his end.\n\nShould I take this as a second chance to try to explain to him\/the department what happened? I don\u2019t even know what would happen to my grades at this point. I feel like I\u2019ve dug myself into a hole and spring classes are so short that missing four days completely threw me off.\n\nAlso, the W deadline is today (June 8th) so idk if it\u2019s too late. \u2018\u2019\u2019:)","2018":"Student mental health services. Is there any like psychologists\u201d services or anything for students? Or counselling? I feel like I need to talk to someone and just get all this negative stuff off my chest. Don\u2019t want to tell friends though. \nThanks","2019":"What, if any, resources\/help does the university offer when it comes to mental health?. I'm fine these days but I need to know what my options are if my mind goes wandering into a deep dark pit again. My biggest fears are that I'll either end up doing permanent damage to myself, if not killing myself, or turn into some psycho that does that to others out of hate and spite and revels in their suffering. Ideally, I would talk to a psychiatrist but I don't necessarily have the money to do that on a regular basis which is why I come here asking if the uni offers any such services to students. It doesn't help that I'm going into engg either, so I need to know.\n\nIf you have any experiences, it would be great to hear those too.\n\nThanks.","2020":"Fresh Start Program. So i\u2019ve been looking into the fresh start program and i had a few questions. For context i\u2019m in my first year in general biological sciences but i wanted to change into a psychology major. \n\na) So what courses do you have to take during the program? if so, \nDo you get to choose the courses? \n\nb) What happens to the courses that i did pass in the fall\/winter semesters? \n\nc) Do i have to retake the ones i failed?\n\nd) when i finish, do i start back from being a first year and having to take junior courses or do I start at second year? \n\ne) do i have to pay for courses in the program on top of the fee of 500 for the program?\n\nf) will i be admitted back into the science faculty or do i have to change? i can go to the arts faculty for psych too so that\u2019s not a problem just wanted to know \n\ng) should i try to appeal the decision? these first two semesters have been really brutal and i\u2019ve had a lot on my plat. do the following reasons have enough grounds for an appeal? i have developed depression for which i\u2019m seeing a therapist now, my car was stolen for the majority of the end of the fall semester and beginning of the winter, and a close family member of mine was diagnosed with terminal cancer. \n\nobviously my marks were my own fault and i didn\u2019t build study habits that i needed to succeed but i really plan on doing better and i\u2019m going to get my act together. \n\ndo you think it\u2019s better for me to try to continue at the university of alberta or do you think i should just accept one of the local university admissions i received for fall?\n\nthank you for your time.","2021":"Looking for a gym buddy?.
