Your life is not defined by what you're doing right now. You never know where you could end up down the road. \n\nI started off at the U of A almost ten years ago, and have found myself back here studying something completely different. I went from Immunology and Infection, to Education, and now Comp Sci. Throughout all of that I have had crippling self-doubt, faced huge financial struggles, and have had a journey of learning about my own mental health (this is my current stage). \n\nUniversity is hard, and not just academically. You may have external pressures, you may be the first in your family to ever be here, you may have an absurd schedule, you may need to work to make ends meet, or be away from family. It is valid and okay to feel like shit. \n\nJust please know, if your despair is so great that it overwhelms your days, that there is help. I know how annoying it can be to hear that, but there is. Over the last few months I have been deeply immersed in the world of finding this mental health help. My local walk-in clinic has actually been incredible. They have helped me figure out a combination of medication that works. The Primary Care Network can connect you with a psychiatrist (who typically have long wait-times, but if you call often you can pick up a cancellation), and even free counselling. \n\nThere are also emergency mental health options, and free drop-in mental health counselling sessions throughout the city:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.eopcn.ca\/classes\/mental-health-classes\/mental-wellness-101-intake-group\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.momentumcounselling.org\/emotional-regulation\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/current-students\/counselling\/workshops\n\nI know that when you feel darkness, it can be overwhelmingly draining to find help, but when you have just a little bit of energy, book an appointment at your local clinic.\n\nYou got this, and if you need some advice or pointers on where to go or who to see, I can try and help if you message me.","1":"Advice Needed!!!. So I'm an international student and moved to edmonton for uni last fall got pretty decent marks in my midterms on fall semester but kinda started to get lower grades in my finals due to depression and bare did any studying. Ended up with an A- B+ B and B-. And in this semester I did pretty badly in my cmput 272 and math 115 30% and 51% not because it's hard but because I barely studied for them as the depression was still there. I literally started math115 2hours before exam. Now I'm finally able to get over my depression and lonliness but right now what's getting worried that I might get really bad grades overall. I'm in my CS BSc with specialization atm and worried whether this semester is going to affect me in future while looking for an internship or a job. Will getting better grades from my 2nd year make up for it? Honestly I was depressed to the core and that resulted in such drop in grades from 90s to 30s.

Any advice or comments would be helpful. Thank you!","11":"\u201cI\u2019ll take a 15-min study break\u201d ..... one hour later:. ","12":"University's response e-mail regarding budget cuts.. The 2020 provincial budget just came out. Like every other post-secondary institution in our province, the budget impacts what will happen at our university.\u00a0 Especially involving things like academic programming, the people that deliver and support that programming, deferred maintenance on our campus, and your tuition and taxes.\u00a0\n\nLast fall, the 2019 budget greatly impacted post-secondary students,\u00a0including making universities (like ours) more reliant on tuition revenues, eliminating beneficial tax credits to students, scrapping the Summer Temporary Employment Program (STEP), reducing student aid funding, raising the interest rate on provincial student loans, and even more. This is what launched the Students Not Silent movement on our campus, which has now spread to campuses across Alberta.\n\nAnd, now,\u00a0budget 2020 has doubled down on placing that burden on students. Here\u2019s where things are at now:\n\nYour tuition is still going up.\n\nThe provincial government is trying to reduce how much they put into funding post-secondary education, which in turn is forcing institutions to try to find ways to make up those amounts. As per the provincial budget, they expect much of this to be done through increased tuition revenues; tuition is able to increase by an average of 7%\u00a0each year\u00a0over the next three years. Some programs will be seeing hikes of up to 10% in 2021 and 2022.\n\nWhat this means for you: Your education is about to get more expensive. For example, a student taking 10 classes next year could expect to pay at least $370 more in tuition, and $1,200 more by 2022. (Next year, Alberta tuition will be 375% higher than it was in 1990-91; that's five times the rate of inflation!)\n\n\nOn top of that, there is a lot of pressure on the university to fill seats, by whatever means.\n\nEven though we\u2019re already at record enrolment levels, the provincial budget is projecting tuition revenues to increase 6.9% in each of the next three years. That puts major stress on the university to fill seats, despite cuts to programs, more expensive tuition, job loss, and a low priority on addressing maintenance issues in student spaces.\u00a0\n\nWhat this means for you: Your class sizes will probably be larger. And, considering the university is likely to reduce courses being offered, it will probably be harder for you to get into classes or have options to fit into your schedule.\u00a0\n\n\nEven if the U of A performs well, there won\u2019t be any funding increases.\u00a0\n\nThe new\u00a0performance-based funding model\u2019s \"all stick, no carrot\" approachmeans there\u2019s nowhere to go but down: hidden cuts will drain university funding even beyond the\u00a0new 11% cut to operating funding.\n\nWhat this means for you: There\u2019s a really, really good chance that programs and courses are going to be facing further, deeper cuts.\n\n\nAnd, still:\n\nYour tuition and education tax credits aren\u2019t coming back, and can no longer be accrued.\u00a0(Note: you can still use \u2018em if you got \u2018em.) You and your family used to be eligible for tax credits of around $1000 per year of university. Those tax credits were eliminated on January 1st.\n\nYour Alberta student loans are going to be more expensive to pay back.Many of us probably got the email that interest on student rates are now higher. At this new rate, an average total loan amount of $30,000, over 10 years, will cost you about $1,800 extra over the course of your repayment.\u00a0\n\nStudent mental health funding is uncertain, at best.\u00a0The one-year renewal on mental health funding (shared with other institutions) is set to expire March 31, 2021, and we don\u2019t know if the U of A\u2019s chunk of that will be less than it has been before.\u00a0\n\nNo sustainable solution to address deferred maintenance.\u00a0The U of A needs around $150 million a year for building maintenance and repairs, yet only $35 million has been allocated. It would take much more than that to fix what needs to be fixed: in five years, the U of A\u2019s deferred maintenance liability will be almost $900 million.\n\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe U of A has difficult decisions to make.\u00a0We already have an idea of what those difficult decisions mean for students, but with the new performance-metric model to be implemented in less than a month, and the shocking 11% cut to the U of A\u2019s operating grant, you should be anticipating big changes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSeriously, the 11% cut to the U of A\u2019s operating grant is devastating. And disproportionately higher than the 6.3% cut at the University of Calgary.\u00a0Coupled with last fall\u2019s 6.9% cut, that means UAlberta is losing roughly $110 million within a few months. Hundreds of jobs are going to be lost. The Board of Governors thought they were being safe by planning for a 5% cut this year. They were wrong.\n\nThere are big increases coming to student tuition, fees, parking rates, residence rates, and meals plans. The hikes to parking rates, meal plans, and residence rents (at or below 5%) have already been decided. The Board of Governors will make decisions on tuition, fees, and residence rents (above 5%) on March 13:\n\nTuition:\u00a0Increasing by 7% for domestic students and 4% for continuing (non-cohorted) international students. Our advocacy efforts succeeded in directing 15% of that new tuition revenue for domestic students to needs-based student financial aid (about $1.83M), and limiting international tuition increases to 4%; they could have been much higher.\n\nParking rates:\u00a0Increasing 2% across the board, or between $1.79-$4.25 more per month, depending on location.\n\nMandatory Non-Instructional Fees:\u00a0Increasing by 2.67% overall (an extra $21.12\/year for a full-time student). This breaks down into a 10% increase for the Athletics and Recreation fee, a 0.94% increase for the Academic Support fee, and a 0% increase for the Health and Wellness fee.\n\nResidence rates:\u00a0Most residences are to increase their rates by 5% (an extra $37-$80 per month), while East Campus Village\u2019s transition from 11 to 8 month leases would increase rates by 10%, and, concluding renovations, Lister-Mackenzie residence would increase by 72% for single rooms and 116% for doubles ($493 more\/month for a 1-bedroom, and $524 more\/month for a 2-bedroom).\n\nMeal plans:\u00a02.9% increases across the board for Lister, Peter Lougheed, and Augustana (costing $130-$148 more per year).","13":"CMPUT 272 final in a few hrs. did horrible on the mids and need a 60%+  on the final to pass honestly i probably deserve to fail, i didn't really put any effort and barley attended class untill it was already too late, it not like i had any special circumstance i was just a idiot. but like i reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally dont want to fail, lol i know its selfish and probably even a bit rude to the people that actually worked hard. im just making this post to vent a bit of stress","14":"So...as an international student, should I go back to Canada for Fall?.

Hello!\n\n i am wondering if I need to do any math courses for my degree. I will be taking cmput 174 +175 to fill the 6\\* requirement of mathematical sciences in my bio degree since I kinda dislike math and want to keep away from it as much as possible. Is math a pre-req or a requirement for any degrees such as medicine, dentistry, or therapy (Occupational, etc.)? I know stats is important and so I will be taking that.\n\n Thanks for your help!","23":"What should I do after getting NC in CMPUT 495, Cs Honors?. Hey guys, I just finished the 1st year of my cs honors degree at uofa. I had some really personal stuff that affected me; My dad passed away from Covid and it was difficult for me to cope up with the stress of classes. Luckily, I managed to pull through with a 3.7 for the year. However, I just couldn't attend a lot of the lectures and I missed out on CMPUT 495 completely, and I got graded NC for it. So I don't know what the process is now. Like, do I apply for a switch to specialization or do I wait until fall or winter, or can I try and convince someone? Please help me out here, I really don't know what to do about this.","24":"My hell first year is finally over. Honestly IMO, not worth going through death to get this.. ","25":"Can some senior CS student please help a fellow noob understand the basics of class selection at the university. I am a second year BSc general student. I know class registration started almost a month ago but I had some health and family issues that had me occupied, and I am optimistic I will get a seat in most classes till the time classes start this fall. I was in Honours for fall 2020 semester but was transferred to BSc general because I didn't do well studying online(didn't do winter 2021 semester). My problem is I have no idea how to go about selecting classes as I have never done this before and I am unable to understand this new and slightly intimidating system. I would ask the science advisors for help but I don't even know what to ask and where to get started, and I have very bad social anxiety so I would prefer to talk to a fellow student to get a basic grasp of the situation before I approach an authority for assistance. I just want to get a half-decent hold on some fundamental things about opting for CS classes, I wouldn't take a lot of your time. If there is a kind senior CS student who is willing to help me navigate this maze of dozens of classes and requirements and complexities, I would be very very grateful.","26":"Well damn, I guess it was too much for people to get the vaccine. If we go online mid semester again, I'm gonna cry :(. ","27":"For those of you who have used counseling services. I am overwhelmed with anxiety at the moment about various things at once. In your experience, how much does a counselor help? What is your experience generally with the counseling services? Does expressing ones emotions to someone in of itself help relieve tension?","28":"Cmput 379 importance?. Recently i wrote a post about my worries on cmput 229. Tbh, the only reason i\u2019m taking it is because its a pre req for cmput 379 (and maybe cmput 325). I know alot of people say its 379 is an essential course to take, but i\u2019m not even sure if i\u2019m interested in it or if its worth the stress of cmput 229, especially if cmput 379 is harder than. 229. Right now i\u2019m so stressed about the course all the time. I know that alot of people will drop later (making the curve harder) and looking at the labs, i\u2019m not sure even starting early will help me. This is killing me and i can\u2019t even relax","29":"Make your bets people! I say we go online by the end of next week..

I am a first-year BSc student and I am honestly struggling mentally because I feel that my grades aren't good enough and I am not good enough even though my grades SO FAR have been about 13% above the class average.  I feel like I literally know nothing because I crammed for the exams but still did ok.  I am not used to constantly looking at averages and stuff or being compared to others and it's hitting me harder than I expected.  I have never crammed before and I know I need to change my study habits, easier said than done.  I would just like some words of encouragement or maybe some links to mental help support or something because this school is so big and I feel so alone.  All I have are the dumb numbers to look at.  \n\nTIA for reading.","31":"It pays off! :D. My gosh, I just got an internship at a company I really wanted to work at!\n\nAfter all the sleepless nights, doubts, October mental breakdowns, getting bodied by every Compsci class and that asshole impostor syndrome.

I've been doing this back-and-forth decision or changing my major my entire time here at UofA. Right now I'm taking a comp sci degree, while I enjoy some of it, other parts are making me reconsider. Most of the time I was scared of the difficulty of the courses, now I'm starting to think about if I would really enjoy working in the industry, especially since I started taking cmput 401. But now I'm in my 4th year (both credit-wise and time-wise). I'm not sure if my feelings are valid or if anxiety is influencing my decision, but now I really need to decide if this degree is right for me. The problem is I don't know if I would enjoy some of these degrees or if I am interested and change, would I hate it and be stuck in another major I don't enjoy. I was thinking of doing another degree (like at nait) after I graduated, but now I'm not sure if I would enjoy comp sci enough to finish it (without affecting my mental health). I really don't know what to do and it's scaring me, especially now when i\\\\m at the end","33":"LRT safety issues will probably resolve before Fall 2022. Right now there's a lot of people that don't feel safe on the LRT due to a larger and more aggressive homeless population, which is very understandable. However, I think that this is largely a pandemic issue and will likely resolve itself once covid-19 dies down. Nobody knows for certain when that will be, but with boosters and milder covid variants, my guess would be before Fall 2022.\n\nHere's my case:\n\n1. Covid precautions have reduced capacity in homeless shelters and other treatment facilities\/programs. This means more homeless and drug addicts sleeping rough and out in public spaces.\n2. Fewer \"normal\" transit users are around to crowd out problematic ones due to remote working. This means that the homeless and drug addicts are more visible and it's easier for aggressive ones to pick on isolated victims. Also, generally people feel safer when there's lots of watching eyes around (I know I do).\n3. Valley line Southeast will open up this summer, so starting in Fall 2022 there will be ridership from a whole new quadrant of the city. Churchill station is the transfer point to get to the university from the Valley line, so everywhere between Churchill and University should see a lot more foot traffic.\n4. A return to pre-pandemic revenue levels for ETS means that it will be easier for them to fund better security. Right now they are in a tough spot, with reduced ridership but higher costs.\nA lot of people are voicing their concerns about transit safety right now, and it's important to get that message out. But I would hate for this to turn into a death spiral for the transit system, with everyone hearing how bad it is and opting to buy a car and drive - exacerbating safety and revenue issues which turn more people away from transit (and so on).\n\nSo when we talk about how things are bad on the LRT, I hope the call to action is to push the City for better transit security and the province for more money towards shelters and mental health - not to convince students they need to take on 7-10k\/year in debt to pay for a car.","34":"Unpopular opinion: I am really liking online. I am a second year. On my first year I absolutely hated online, different formats in all classes, nobody knew what to do, smart exam, you name it. Now after literally having the worst semester I thought online were going to be crap but they are actually really helping, Look, I know the effects on mental health and all that but  I work 3 days a week and commute for almost 1 hour every single day to and back from the university (Train included) plus the hour that it takes me to get ready and make breakfast. I live alone and I gotta do all my crap, and that takes time. I am having a better sleep,capable of keeping track of all my classes partly because I am not spending 3 hours a day just getting to the darn place and partly because is just so much easier to ask questions on zoom. Lectures are recorded and I can go at my own pace, and decide my own schedule. I don\u2019t have to run from ECHA to CAB every other day. I am not minding this online shift at all. Of course there might be other extraneous factors like nicer course load and that might cause a bias, but as a comp Sci student I honestly don\u2019t mind. Getting to sleep in and wake up 5 minutes before class without feeling like your world is falling apart is great.","35":"Is cmput 204 necessary in second year?(4 year graduation). I was planning to take it in 3rd year Fall with cmput 301,  since basically every 300 level course requires 204, am I too late on taking it at 3rd year? Or is it still doable, please let me know. Thankss. Im taking it right now, but am having difficulty due to mental health issues right now and would like to withdraw and take it later.","36":"Computing science honors transfer. I have a few questions regarding applying to transfer to CS honors. In Admission chart 7 it says:  a minimum 3.0 GPA on \u260524 in each preceding Fall\/Winter and a minimum 3.0 GPA on all CMPUT courses completed and eligible for transfer.  Although the \u260524 gives enough implications, does each preceding Fall\/Winter means the most recent Fall\/Winter or ALL Fall\/Winter? \n\nAlso, due to mental health issue I performed very poorly in my first year (Fs) but over the past 2 years, I was able to maintain my GPA (mostly transferable courses) at around 3.9.  I worry that repeated courses will lower my AGPA and I believe that my grades over the past 2 years are more indicative. Should I mention this to the admission office?","37":"Anxiety over introductory computer science courses and suggestions to fix the problems. I can't wait to finish this semester and be done with introductory computer science courses so I could move on to bigger and better things with larger amount of complexity. The introductory computer science courses asssignment are large in scope so they don't give me a lot of anxious because it is large enough where it is impossible for two person to have similar code unless they copied from each other. Also there is no skeleton and no well-defined functions that we have to follow so there is a lot of room for creavity and uniqueness.\n\nHowever, the lab.  They just give me a lot of annxiety because the functions are well-defined and it come with a lot skeleton code where you have to fill in the blank. I look at some of the functions and I think to myself that there are possibly 2-3 ways at almost to do each of them. I always tried to find the solution that is least to be taken by other people but sometime I just do what is the obvious and put the first solution that came to mind.\n\nIn my first semester in CMPUT 174, I saw 100+ people in the course across the university got caight into scandal of copying from online materials so I did some investigations and I found out that is has been happening for years. While I am happy that the department have implemented the lab demo section to conduct oral exam students to double check. It didn't solved the problem.\n\nMy proprosal for the department is to adpot the style in CMPUT 350 for CMPUT 174\/CMPUT 175, where during the student lab time (2.5 hours) , student must complete the lab assignment within that time frame. In the lab section, they wil have no acess to the internet, no usb, closed-book and could only use the language documents to complete the assignment.  I think that this will make the student better programmers who could think under pressure but it would make impossible for them to cheat on their assignments. Given how there are different lab sections, each lab TA could make assignments and make each lab assignment section unique.\n\nWhat do you think about?","38":"Transition to in-person survey results.

I was definitely not at the top end of the spectrum but my advice to the next generation of applicants would be to apply as soon as possible the earlier the better and also choose to do general rather then specialization or honors if you don\u2019t think you have a competitive average because I feel as though it made it easier for me to get. They will definitely take their time to respond to applicants and the stress will nearly kill you it you. I just wanted to let everyone else who applied know this information. If you have a 89 or 88 I think you can be confident in your application and be int accepted in June.","41":"Confused between CS and Computer Engineering. Hi,   \nA first-year engineer here. I want to start off by sharing my experience in engineering so far. I came into engineering expecting that it would be hard but it turned out to be way harder. I am an international student who came a day before classes started. Clueless I was to find my classes. Managed to pull through the first semester and did fairly well(3.7ish) in the fall sem. I was stressed through most of the first semester. Next comes the winter semester, the shift to online impacted my mental health. I had to go to ER a couple of times and made at least made 15 trips to UHC. I probably experienced the worst time of my life during some of the weeks. Felt extremely lonely and homesick. From being crying in my bed to having an absolute mental breakdown. I felt being pressured by my previous self(fall sem). I ended up dropping a class that is not really a pre-requisite for any of the computer engineering classes but still I will have to take it at some point in time. I really like the freedom of classes in CS and taking 5 courses which would leave time to enjoy life but I also feel like I could still do well in computer engineering. Considering my mental health which could improve over the summer, should I still stay in engineering? I have already applied for computer science.","42":"Happy Easter! God bless you all: ). ","43":"Hi all, I have a few questions about some decisions I have to make going into my second year.. The first question is very specific to my degree while the second is very general.\n\n1. I nearly failed CMPUT 272, and I have heard this class is often a marker for success in further cmput courses (204) and in computing science in general. Furthermore, I am in CS honors so I have to maintain an average gpa of 3.0 between my cmput courses. Hopefully an A+ and A- in cmput 174 and 175 can average my likely D in 272 to a 3.0, but I am not sure. If I stay in honors I'm quite worried about the discrete math ahead. I felt very comfortable with all the content up to and including set theory. However, I realistically could have gotten 0 on the rest of the exam (relations and functions and counting). If anybody could provide some resources that could better help me understand discrete math, or give advice on finding success in courses like 204, 201, 291, and 229 that would be greatly appreciated.\n2. My home situation is really uncomfortable for me. During the in-person semesters I stayed in residence, as I live quite far away in Alberta. I really enjoyed it and am looking to rent a place with the same roommates next year. During the summer though, I have some difficult decisions to make. My parents are so ridiculously negative and overbearing that I believe it's taking a toll on my mental health. Every day is a struggle to avoid them as much as possible. Right now I am currently looking for a job, and have been searching for the past few days with no success so far. I will of course keep trying, but I cannot spend any time relaxing in the ways I want to as I will just get lectured and berated by my parents. Once I get a job, it will be just like last summer where I will be told to spend my free time studying or applying for scholarships or searching for a second job. This really makes me want to move out, but that would take a huge cut out of what I contribute to my tuition and my semester budget. The last resort would be covering my parent's half of tuition with student loans and accepting the increased debt that would come with them. I only have 3 years left until I can move out and begin \"real\" adulthood, but it will come at the cost of a lot of my relationships from high school and such that I have been trying hard to maintain. If anyone has been in a similar situation before, any advice on the mindset to adopt and the decisions to make would help a lot. Thank you for reading."},"preprocessed_post":{"0":["answer","right","life","define","right","never","know","could","end","road","start","almost","ten","year","ago","find","back","study","something","completely","different","immunology_infection","education","comp_sci","throughout","cripple","self","doubt","face","huge","financial","struggle","journey","learn","mental_health","current","stage","university","hard","academically","may","external","pressure","may","first","family","ever","may","absurd","schedule","may","need","work","make","end","meet","away","family","valid","okay","feel","like","shit","please","know","despair","great","overwhelms","day","help","know","annoy","hear","last","month","deeply","immersed","world","find","mental_health","help","local","walk","clinic","actually","incredible","helped","figure","combination","medication","work","primary","care","network","connect","psychiatrist","typically","long","wait","time","call","often","pick","cancellation","even","free","counselling","also","emergency","mental_health","option","free","drop","mental_health","counselling","session","throughout","city","www","eopcn","class","mental_health","class","mental","wellness","intake","group","www","momentumcounselling","org","emotional","regulation","www","ualberta","current","student","counsel","workshop","know","feel","darkness","overwhelmingly","drain","find","help","little","bit","energy","book","appointment","local","clinic","get","need","advice","pointer","see","try","help","message"],"1":["advice","need","international","student","move","edmonton","uni","last","fall","get","pretty","decent","mark","midterm","fall","semester","kinda","start","get","low","grade","final","due","depression","bare","study","end","semester","pretty","badly","cmput","math","hard","barely","study","depression","still","literally","start","math","hour","exam","finally","able","get","depression","lonliness","right","get","worry","might","get","really","bad","grade","overall","bsc","specialization","atm","worry","whether","semester","affect","future","look","internship","job","get","good","grade","year","make","honestly","depress","core","result","drop","grade","almost","math","math"],"2":["would","keep","register","close","heart","bit","heart","give","space","deserve","talk","girl","study"],"3":["would","keep","register","close","bit","heart","give","space","deserve","talk","girl","study"],"4":["advice","need","buying","bike","consider","buy","bike","commute","university","good","idea","bike","theft","problem","get","cheap","bike","good","enough","commute","university","thing","must","take","care"],"5":["cab","renovation","elimination","plugins","like","seriously","plugins","east","wall","addition","table","plug","chair"],"6":["confuse","life","hate","complain","cause","really","dont","want"],"7":["alberta","budget","summary","ucp","budget","thing","settle","little","bit","federal","election","take","time","read","budget","article","budget","compile","list","major","point","find","tried","keep","personal","opinion","make","unbiased","possible","pretty","long","think","everyone","give","read","understand","government","number","year","unless","noted","otherwise","tax","reduction","corporate","tax","rate","removal","index","personal","income","tax","effectively","raise","tax","inflation","every","year","investinganswers","com","dictionary","tax","index","provincial","tuition","tax","credit","carbon","tax","tier","stay","ndp","per","tonne","however","pay","distribution","change","target","longer","set","government","instead","set","comparison","facility","previous","carbon","emission","opt","high","performance","target","whichever","less","stringent","mean","large","producer","carbon","save","around","million","next","year","additionally","tier","revenue","spend","broad","list","thing","rather","clean","energy","initiative","dollar","carton","tax","increase","cigarettes","plan","implement","tax","vaping","product","education","post","secondary","education","million","year","government","expect","loss","job","next","year","include","university","college","trade","school","additional","funding","accommodate","additional","student","ata","head","say","equate","cut","dollar","per","student","less","tuition","freeze","lift","increase","cap","move","per","year","year","max","cut","grant","class","size","fee","reduction","classroom","improvement","add","one","time","transitional","grant","student","loan","interest","rate","prime","prime","plus","loan","holder","pay","year","extra","per","month","per","year","accord","government","official","environment","kill","million","climate","change","initiative","agriculture","forestry","indigenous","climate","initiative","energy","small","amount","tier","fund","invest","carbon","capture","oil","sand","efficiency","technology","million","tier","towards","deficit","million","tier","energy","war","room","combat","misinformation","oil","industry","alberta","energy","regulator","set","lose","job","roughly","see",
