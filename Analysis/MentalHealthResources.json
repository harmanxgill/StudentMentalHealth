My heart's still pounding and my anxiety is so bad I feel like throwing up. Growing up with child abusers, my parents indoctrinated me to think that getting mental health counselling was bad and if I ever tried to get any, they'd put me in the foster care system. It's so hard for me to ask for help as a result of that. I'd tried therapy in high school and it was an absolute gift; but my psychologist had moved away when first year started. My girlfriend in first year tried getting me to go to the CCS because my depression and anxiety were out of control. I went in and they had to turn down my walk-in. That really messed me up but I was fine.\n\nOver the next few months, I scheduled appointments but had to cancel because a relative had gotten cancer the day of, my mom was catching wind of my activities, and just university got in the way. After two years, I finally got the courage yesterday to call the CCS and make an appointment I was determined to attend. The receptionist ended up listing all my \"cancellations\" and there was such contempt in her voice, I felt my heart sink. It was so damn hard to make that call and she made me feel like someone who did not deserve help because life got in the way of my appointments to better myself. Even before I gave her my ID number, she sounded aggravated and I couldn't pinpoint why.\n\nIs this a normal? A lot of reviews on reddit said the psychologists weren't any better and that scares me.","1":"UPDATE: I went to my CCS appointment and the intake nurse was awesome.. Originally the receptionist\u2019s tone and attitude towards my cancellations had made me really scared and all the threads about how horrible the MHS were didn\u2019t really help. But to anyone who\u2019s been scared to seek help, there are people there who are good and comforting. \n\nAs soon as I walked in, I felt the need to apologize for all my cancellations. But she just looked at me and smiled and said \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. You showed up now. That matters.\u201d I felt heard and she was just so down to earth. She gave me strategies and advice to help with before my appointment and I felt understood. \n\nI know a lot of people are fairly scared to try out the mental health services because of the past but I really think you should try it out.","2":"therapist so i dont drop out. I really think I need to see a counselor or a therapist or someone because I seriously want to drop out of university and just never get out of bed again. I don't know how to get one or find one. Also is there any way to talk to someone and not get charged because aside from hating my life I'm broke :)","3":"How does one go about getting medication for anxiety and other psychiatric problems?. Hello, in the past I used to take meds for depression and I stopped for about two years but now my anxiety is back and I don't know how to go about this. I read about CCS on the university's website but honestly that just looks like useless extra steps cause I know the problems I have but I was diagnosed in my home country and not in Canada.\n\nHow do I get my damn meds without speaking to the SUB people (with whom I didn't have a good experience in the past when it came to other medical problems)?","4":"Why GFC Debate Matters- Educate Yourself First. The U of A is the only U15 University in Canada that implemented a mandatory CR\/ NCR. What people don't understand is how this policy took place. \n\nThe General Faculty Council is composed of 150 plus members. The GFC Executive is limited to 20 to 30 people. \n\nThe GFC Executive made this decision without consulting with the whole council. Even if they have the power to do that, it shows the lack of democratic and sound decision making protocol this university has. \n\nThis university is a shit show. Mental health means nothing to the higher ups. Science dean keeps on using \"promoting students health at this time\" when every student at the U of A is obviously 100000x as stressed as any other university. \n\nIt dosen't matter about NCR \/ CR whatever. It matters when in times like these, our university reveals themselves and shows us who they really are. \n\nBtw, CCS is now closed. They said university health centers and stuff will remain open. They are now limiting to one session over the phone. \n\nThe average student has no idea how policies are made, how decisions are taken.  U of A's decision making protocol has been the worst in the country. \n\nThat's why we are the only university to ADOPT a pass \/ fail system blanket approach. \n\nU of Toronto, U of Calgary, McGill, University of Manitoba, Queen's University are all giving students the option.\n\nIt's not even about credit no credit. It's now about how our university made a decision that was made by 20 top University officials and never bothered taking the whole councils opinion.","5":"hi I am your fellow international student facing emotional, mental and physical burnout. I read multiple posts here about feeling burnt out and shit. Honestly, I've never been in this deep shit as this semester. Saying that won't make anything better for anyone but yeah. This is a total vent, ngl. Im away from home and I really don't have any friends here. I live by myself and my apartment is the loneliest place like. With covid, I have stopped hanging out with my bf too because his parents are kinda strict are healthcare people so he doesn't want to put me at risk.\n\nI am just like so tired and done. and that's it. also, please if there is anyone around you or someone you know, or a friend you haven't talked to in a long time, and you know they seek comfort in you, reach out to them and if you need to talk, reach out. It is good to be in touch with your emotions.\n\ntake care comrades","6":"Depression - Cipralex?. Hello, sorry for posting this here but I really need some insights. I went to the UHC because my counselor (counselling services) recommended me to. They prescribed me Cipralex for depression and wanted to know if anyone here have tried this medication? I've never used antidepressants before so I'm hesitant on taking it. The GP i met with told me that most common side effects are dizziness, nausea and headache. Are the side effects bad enough to impact my academics? (I'm already always tired and no motivation and so behind with school stuff so im worried things might get worse because of the side effects), especially that it's almost end of the term and finals coming up.\n\nWith that in mind, to anyone who have tried it, do you recommend taking it during christmas break instead so there are fewer commitments\/ no school related things to do? \n\nAlso, I'll be paying this through my own pocket (full time student, no job) anywhere i could get this medication for a cheaper dispensing fee where i could save more? \n\nThank you and really hope you guys could help me with this.","7":"Undergrad SpringCourses Available.

[By Dr. Jillian Buriak, Canada Research Chair and Professor in the Department of Chemistry]. Dear President Bill Flanagan, Provost Steven Dew, Board of Governors Chair Kate Chisholm,\n\nIn under one month, classes begin at the University of Alberta, with more than 40,000 students from around the world converging on our campuses. In addition, faculty and staff who have been largely off-site during the global pandemic will join them. We want nothing more than a normal campus experience, replete with the energy and excitement that makes campus learning and life an essential part of the educational experience. It is an understatement that COVID19 has upended this campus life, and we are about to take the first steps back to normalcy. While the vaccines are remarkably effective, they are only effective if two doses make it into one\u2019s arm. Without mandatory vaccinations, [campus shutdowns are inevitable](https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/opinion\/article-without-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-on-campus-we-will-face-another\/?utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+\/+Media&amp;utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links). \n\n**The Delta variant is a beast.** The Delta variant of COVID19 has suddenly changed the game, and will certainly not be the last variant of concern to do so. Delta is unlike the strains of SARS-CoV-2 we have dealt with in the past, with an [Ro equal to chicken pox (\\~6)](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/delta-variant-cdc-contagious-1.6124795), meaning that it is highly transmissible, with the main route being [via aerosols and respiratory droplets](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/health-professionals\/main-modes-transmission.html).  While fully vaccinated individuals, more than 2 weeks post second inoculation, are largely protected, the rates of vaccination of the [age 20-24 demographic ](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/alberta-covid-19-data-statistics-numbers-cases-hospitalizations-1.5514947)in Alberta are significantly lower than the provincial average, which is already [the lowest in the country](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/edmonton\/alberta-vaccination-rates-1.6119338). Today, fewer than half of people of this age in Alberta are fully vaccinated, with about 30% totally unvaccinated with zero shots. While we do hope that our students will have higher vaccination rates than the general population, this critical but unknown data point makes it impossible to ensure that the Delta variant does not rip through the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated segment of these tens of thousands of students, and the staff and faculty who support them, who will be walking through and sitting in very crowded settings. Combined with unknowns regarding ventilation and filtration of our classrooms and common areas, particularly in very large lecture halls, superspreader events need to be seriously considered. Aerosols of viral particles are as mobile as smoke, and without proper ventilation and HEPA\/MERV 13 filtration, superspreading is likely. Our colleague, Nelson Amaral, described succinctly the \u201csuper-mixing\u201d of students on campus (link [here](https:\/\/edmontonjournal.com\/opinion\/letters\/fridays-letters-covid-measures-needed-for-university)) in a letter to the Edmonton Journal, who said \"If we tried to design a system to rapidly spread a contagious virus during a pandemic, it would be difficult to come up with a more efficient system than the massive dynamic close proximity of university campuses.\" \n\n**Public health guidelines are insufficient for a university environment; responsibility to our stakeholders.** While the University of Alberta has stated that safety is the top priority for a smooth fall return (link [here](https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/covid-19\/about\/campus-2021-22.html)), we are extremely concerned that this plan, as outlined, could fail, and that in-person teaching and other normal activities could end prematurely. The very last thing any of us would like to see is for students, faculty, and staff to fall ill and force us to pivot back online. We also do not want our community to be the cause of additional stress on our healthcare system. We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to create a safe learning environment for all students. \n\n**Long COVID, and unvaccinated children.** Another huge concern is the faculty, staff, and students who have children not-yet-eligible for vaccination, a large and highly susceptible cohort of thoroughly COVID19-naive children. Pediatric ICU\u2019s are being overwhelmed [in some US states](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jemimamcevoy\/2021\/07\/29\/hospitals-in-southern-us-reporting-record-numbers-of-children-hospitalized-amid-delta-surge-though-deaths-still-extremely-rare\/?sh=13fe6a7c5f1e); the UK has almost identical vaccination rates to us and [cases](https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/healthandsocialcare\/conditionsanddiseases\/bulletins\/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot\/30july2021#age-analysis-of-the-number-of-people-who-had-covid-19) in children are rising. While early and playing out in real-time, some data from the UK suggests that substantial numbers of children who are infected with COVID19 still suffer from one or more symptoms 120 days later, which impair their daily lives; some data suggest as high as 40% of children are thus affected ([link](https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg24933233-600-children-are-getting-long-covid-and-being-left-with-lasting-problems\/); open access Pubmed [link](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7927578\/)). Again, this data is being collected in real time, and in the face of the Delta variant, we believe that the precautionary principle should apply. [Long COVID](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/373\/6554\/491) in adults as well also has to be emphasized, with perhaps 10-25% of those having suffered through COVID19 being affected for months, and perhaps years, with debilitating symptoms. We cannot risk substantial swaths of our community suffering from preventable long COVID. \n\n**Stress due to rational concerns and unanswered questions.** Many of your faculty, staff, and students are extremely stressed. This stress results not from an irrational fear of change (which would be more suitably termed anxiety) as we open society up, but from highly rational and science-based concerns regarding the aerosol nature of COVID19, the unknowns of ventilation in our teaching and crowded common spaces, the fact that sick people no longer are required to self-isolate, that mask-wearing is merely encouraged but not mandatory, that Delta is so highly contagious, and that long COVID can be debilitating. We emphasize that these concerns are rational, and the only way these extreme worries can be alleviated is with clear direction and information. \n\n**Our 4 Requests.** We would like to request the following as general public health guidelines are insufficient for a university campus with tens of thousands of students in these congregate and crowded settings. \n\n**1. Mandatory vaccinations** for all faculty, staff, and students on campus. \n\n**2. Mandatory masks** must be worn in classrooms, hallways. Ideally, masks would be N95-grade or similar (or ASTM2 surgical mask + a mask seal, such as a [Badger Seal](https:\/\/making.engr.wisc.edu\/mask-fitter\/)) to effectively filter sub-micron particles. Based on current data regarding the delta variant, the CDC now [recommends](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/vaccines\/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html) mandatory masking in schools.\n\n**3. Measure and share ventilation and filtration data\/informatio**n for all common spaces, including classroom and lecture halls. ASHRAE clearly indicates that COVID is airborne and aerosolized (link [here](https:\/\/www.ashrae.org\/file%20library\/technical%20resources\/covid-19\/iea-bahnfleth-5may20.pdf)) and has made specific recommendations to reduce airborne infectious aerosol exposure (link [here](https:\/\/www.ashrae.org\/file%20library\/technical%20resources\/covid-19\/core-recommendations-for-reducing-airborne-infectious-aerosol-exposure.pdf)). We need to follow these recommendations, and share the information with the users of these spaces. From eACH (hourly air exchanges\/ventilation) &gt; 6, to HEPA and MERV 13 (flltration), we cannot ignore the concerns of occupants regarding air quality. \n\n**4. Institute rapid testing.** Since some fraction of the population will arrive on campus unvaccinated, vaccination clinics will take time. We will be well into October for some to develop full immunity (4 week delay between inoculations, and 2 week delay post-second dose). Start a frequent rapid testing program for these individuals. \n\nTime is running short. We hope that a rapid uptake of these ideas can make our fall semester successful. We want nothing more. \n\nYours truly, \n\n**To sign, click here:** [**https:\/\/forms.gle\/qoCPtgZcd1WK2fP29**](https:\/\/forms.gle\/qoCPtgZcd1WK2fP29)","10":"Open letter: Request for mandatory vaccinations and masking, air quality information (ventilation and filtration), &amp; rapid testing to ensure a safe fall return to campus.. Dear President Bill Flanagan, Provost Steven Dew, Board of Governors Chair Kate Chisholm,\n\nIn under one month, classes begin at the University of Alberta, with more than 40,000 students from around the world converging on our campuses. In addition, faculty and staff who have been largely off-site during the global pandemic will join them. We want nothing more than a normal campus experience, replete with the energy and excitement that makes campus learning and life an essential part of the educational experience. It is an understatement that COVID19 has upended this campus life, and we are about to take the first steps back to normalcy. While the vaccines are remarkably effective, they are only effective if two doses make it into one\u2019s arm. Without mandatory vaccinations, [campus shutdowns are inevitable](https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/opinion\/article-without-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-on-campus-we-will-face-another\/?utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+\/+Media&amp;utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links).\n\n**The Delta variant is a beast.** The Delta variant of COVID19 has suddenly changed the game, and will certainly not be the last variant of concern to do so. Delta is unlike the strains of SARS-CoV-2 we have dealt with in the past, with an [Ro equal to chicken pox (\\~6)](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/health\/delta-variant-cdc-contagious-1.6124795), meaning that it is highly transmissible, with the main route being [via aerosols and respiratory droplets](https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/public-health\/services\/diseases\/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection\/health-professionals\/main-modes-transmission.html). While fully vaccinated individuals, more than 2 weeks post second inoculation, are largely protected, the rates of vaccination of the [age 20-24 demographic ](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/calgary\/alberta-covid-19-data-statistics-numbers-cases-hospitalizations-1.5514947)in Alberta are significantly lower than the provincial average, which is already [the lowest in the country](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/edmonton\/alberta-vaccination-rates-1.6119338). Today, fewer than half of people of this age in Alberta are fully vaccinated, with about 30% totally unvaccinated with zero shots. While we do hope that our students will have higher vaccination rates than the general population, this critical but unknown data point makes it impossible to ensure that the Delta variant does not rip through the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated segment of these tens of thousands of students, and the staff and faculty who support them, who will be walking through and sitting in very crowded settings. Combined with unknowns regarding ventilation and filtration of our classrooms and common areas, particularly in very large lecture halls, superspreader events need to be seriously considered. Aerosols of viral particles are as mobile as smoke, and without proper ventilation and HEPA\/MERV 13 filtration, superspreading is likely. Our colleague, Nelson Amaral, described succinctly the \u201csuper-mixing\u201d of students on campus (link [here](https:\/\/edmontonjournal.com\/opinion\/letters\/fridays-letters-covid-measures-needed-for-university)) in a letter to the Edmonton Journal, who said \"If we tried to design a system to rapidly spread a contagious virus during a pandemic, it would be difficult to come up with a more efficient system than the massive dynamic close proximity of university campuses.\"\n\n**Public health guidelines are insufficient for a university environment; responsibility to our stakeholders.** While the University of Alberta has stated that safety is the top priority for a smooth fall return (link [here](https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/covid-19\/about\/campus-2021-22.html)), we are extremely concerned that this plan, as outlined, could fail, and that in-person teaching and other normal activities could end prematurely. The very last thing any of us would like to see is for students, faculty, and staff to fall ill and force us to pivot back online. We also do not want our community to be the cause of additional stress on our healthcare system. We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to create a safe learning environment for all students.\n\n**Long COVID, and unvaccinated children.** Another huge concern is the faculty, staff, and students who have children not-yet-eligible for vaccination, a large and highly susceptible cohort of thoroughly COVID19-naive children. Pediatric ICU\u2019s are being overwhelmed [in some US states](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jemimamcevoy\/2021\/07\/29\/hospitals-in-southern-us-reporting-record-numbers-of-children-hospitalized-amid-delta-surge-though-deaths-still-extremely-rare\/?sh=13fe6a7c5f1e); the UK has almost identical vaccination rates to us and [cases](https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/healthandsocialcare\/conditionsanddiseases\/bulletins\/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot\/30july2021#age-analysis-of-the-number-of-people-who-had-covid-19) in children are rising. While early and playing out in real-time, some data from the UK suggests that substantial numbers of children who are infected with COVID19 still suffer from one or more symptoms 120 days later, which impair their daily lives; some data suggest as high as 40% of children are thus affected ([link](https:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg24933233-600-children-are-getting-long-covid-and-being-left-with-lasting-problems\/); open access Pubmed [link](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7927578\/)). Again, this data is being collected in real time, and in the face of the Delta variant, we believe that the precautionary principle should apply. [Long COVID](https:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/373\/6554\/491) in adults as well also has to be emphasized, with perhaps 10-25% of those having suffered through COVID19 being affected for months, and perhaps years, with debilitating symptoms. We cannot risk substantial swaths of our community suffering from preventable long COVID.\n\n**Stress due to rational concerns and unanswered questions.** Many of your faculty, staff, and students are extremely stressed. This stress results not from an irrational fear of change (which would be more suitably termed anxiety) as we open society up, but from highly rational and science-based concerns regarding the aerosol nature of COVID19, the unknowns of ventilation in our teaching and crowded common spaces, the fact that sick people no longer are required to self-isolate, that mask-wearing is merely encouraged but not mandatory, that Delta is so highly contagious, and that long COVID can be debilitating.

I'll be going into my first undergrad year at the U of A and I've been struggling quite a lot with my mental health recently. During the campus tours, I noticed that the CCS provides free mental health services. What is the general opinion\/feel of these services? Are they worth going to? If anyone has any experience with going to these kinds of things, it would be really helpful. It feels like its my only option as I don't really want to put financial stress on my parents, so I don't know. I'm scared of the negative experiences that I've heard about.","12":"For those of you who have used counseling services. I am overwhelmed with anxiety at the moment about various things at once. In your experience, how much does a counselor help? What is your experience generally with the counseling services? Does expressing ones emotions to someone in of itself help relieve tension?","13":"What healthcare-related careers are an option for someone with a bachelors of science (pharmacology in my case)?. Currently doing my BSc in pharmacology and realizing graduate studies might not be what I want to do next. I'm already depressed and have no social life, so I genuinely don't think I would make it through 4-6 years of that lmao. As well, I don't ever see myself working in academia, when I look at current job postings at the U of A the salaries are just laughable especially considering they require 8-10 years of schooling (fr why are postdocs only paid like 50k a year???) and I don't ever want to be a professor. I'm already so close to finishing this degree so I may as well do that, but I feel like there really isn't much I can do with it besides going back to school for a whole different diploma\/degree and I can't help but feel like I've wasted my time and I should have done something different right out of high school.\n\nAnywho, I'm currently looking at respiratory therapy at NAIT, as well as some healthcare-related masters programs at other institutions. Besides nursing, dental hygiene, ultrasound tech, and radiation therapy, what are some lesser-known healthcare type jobs that exist outside of medicine?","14":"Planning for winter term - if we are going to try to be in-person..... Prof. here. If we are going to try to be in-person, planning is required. Since COVID is airborne, everyone should be given free personal supply of N95 masks, and rapid testing needs to be accessible, frequent, and free. And if anyone says \"too expensive\", consider the savings of tuition dollars alone of students not bailing on another online term. N95s can be reused with proper care.  Rapid tests are now much more widely available. It's also way cheaper than a healthcare system that is even more overwhelmed than when it was during the fourth wave.  I want my students healthy, and as we all know, health includes mental health by definition. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/cspotweet\/status\/1471159029426638851?s=20","15":"Getting an ADHD assessment\/psych referral?. Hi guys I\u2019m really struggling with signs and symptoms of adhd and I think I\u2019m adamant on having adhd and I\u2019m wondering if I can find other ways to get an assessment that\u2019s covered? I just had an initial consultation with CCS and they said I don\u2019t meet the criteria for a psychiatrist referral even though I told them I really badly wanted\/needed one. I\u2019m a women btw and the psychologist said that I didn\u2019t present the common signs in childhood and chalked up my \u201csigns\u201d to stress\/lack of sleep. It\u2019s really frustrating because a 30 min call wasn\u2019t enough for me to get it all out there and I was wondering if there\u2019s any alternatives. I tried going to a medicentre and the doctor said they\u2019d get me a referral but I haven\u2019t heard from anyone in months. \nShould I try going to the UHC or something? \n\nAnything helps!! TYSM!!","16":"Possibly going to fail the requirements for Y2Q2...AGAIN. Alright so I started engineering fall 2020 and I did bad so I was placed in Y2Q2. My 2021 fall GPA was a 1.8 and I was able to appeal a request to withdraw letter due to some family issues. In order to stay in the faculty, I'd have to get an overall GPA of 2.0 meaning that I'd at least have to get a 2.2 during this winter term but unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to. I was diagnosed with ADHD on the 4th of April and I have been taking meds. The meds help A LOT. I've done probably more studying in a week than I have the whole semester. I feel like I can actually concentrate and do my work. Unfortunately, the semester is already over and I wasn't prescribed soon enough so I wasn't able to get any help during the semester. Hence my grades aren't really recoverable. I am also planning to talk to a counselor about forming study habits and strucure my days correctly. This sounds really stupid but I was hoping to somehow stay in the faculty even though I'm probably gonna fail the Y2Q2 requirements. I genuinely am interested in engineering, I just wasn't able to receive the help I needed in order to succeed. I'd like to read anyone's thoughts on this and I'm hoping for advice. I've also Ombuds via email and I'll probably get a response later today but I really don't know if they could do anything about this. Is there a chance I could stay? If I have to withdraw, can I apply for readmission? Is there any way I can get a third chance due to a genuine mental disability that I just found out about? Please let me know your thoughts and advice. Sorry if I'm being all over the place with my post. Very stressed so I can't structure it properly.Thank you. \n\nTDLR: I was placed in Y2Q2. I successfully appealed a RTW during the fall of my Y2Q2 year. Just found out that I have ADHD and now know why I've been performing poorly but I'm probably getting another RTW.
