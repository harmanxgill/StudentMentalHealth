I did my work and went to class, I had friends I would spend time with, I got fine grades, overall I was pretty content. Then everything took a turn after a few months and one stupid fucking thing that I could have prevented if I had just been more observant and less idiotic began a domino effect and my fast decline into being a horrible student, I was fucking miserable, I had trouble with my work no matter how much I would study, definitely wouldnt go to class enough, I completely closed myself off and wouldn't spend time with anyone, it was rare if u would eat at all, wouldn't get out of bed, got sick, slept too much or not at all, had shit hygiene, wouldn't clean and all that stuff is still happening to this day. It all came came to a head this past week, I had a deferred exam I know I failed which effects my classes this semester and my program as a whole and I can't even get advising time because the advisor i need is booked past the swap/drop date. It also made me realise just how unready I am for every class I am in, it's just a matter of time before i fail those too. I have never even thought of a future where I don't graduate from university in this field but I'm not smart or strong enough to handle it or anything else. I'm watching my entire world fall apart because I couldn't even handle my first semester where I spent so much time justifying my lack of accomplishment and being all alone to stupid life events that made me depressed, I wouldnt make myself grow up and get kn with my life like I should have. I know that people will say this isn't the end of the world and doesn't mean university is over but ever single plan I had is ruined, I can't get help in time and if I did they would probably tell me everything I already know, i have no backup plans and continuing my current courses will be nothing but wasting more money than I already have to pretend i could ever get this degree in the first place.\n",

I'm not that socially awkward or anything but I feel like I've been rejected by my peers so many times, especially when I was younger, so I'm too afraid to attempt to make friends.. It's this weird thing where I want friends but at the same time I'm too scared to fully open up to people. i never really feel like I'm fully being myself because I'm afraid they're going to hurt me in some way. it's kind of pathetic but it's really difficult especially on the weekends and stuff when I see all these people going out with their friends - not that I have that great of a desire to go out or anything, but just seeing the company and relationships that other people have makes me feel really sad.

Sometimes people just want to vent about the distress their mental condition is causing them and want to have a casual conversation about it (as if they were ranting about any other aspect in their life).  Please do not give unsolicited advice because there are professionals to go to.  **However, if they ask for advice go for it.**  The thing is what works for one person might not work for others.  For, example exercise can make those who have body image problems worse.  Please remember, you are not a professional so do not give advice **unless asked** because everyone is different.\n",

            "The transition from high school to university was hard, the work ethic difference was huge and I was in no way ready for it. But something about it all has just just really put me in an all time low and I’m not sure what’s the cause, quite possibly is just everything being pushed onto me all at once. Let’s start off with the feelings I have of being completely empty on the inside. I go day by day with nothing to look forward to really, and even when i do, they just seem like they are dull and boring. I go to school everyday, go to classes, interact with some people, go home, study, eat, sleep, and repeat. It’s a continuous cycle that is dull and lacks any really excitement but is required. Now i understand that i could change things up a bit and hang out with some friends, but the problem is that they never want to hang out. All my friends prioritize everything else in there life and other people in their life more than me. For example, my best friend, every time i ask her to hang out, she always tells me that she wants to go home early, and on the days that she doesn’t, she always reserve them for her boyfriend. She barely replies to my text cause she’s always hanging out with her boyfriend and it gets kinda annoying. Every time she invites me to hang out with them, i always end up declining because I feel so unwelcome. Like the whole third wheeling feeling is horrible but when it’s with them, it’s on a whole other level, they are always secretive and laughing about things and never talk about things that allow me to join in on conversation. As for my other friends, they are always hanging out with their other friend groups and i never get invited, or they go to different schools and find it too bothersome to arrange time to meet up with me. I feel like everyone has their people and I’m jut left in the shadows where i am left alone. On top of that, it always feels like a competition with all my friends, to see who can do the best. I understand that university is strongly built on being the best and getting the best results, but i feel so stupid compared to them, they all have 4.0 GPAs with minimal effort and dont even show up to class and I’m stuck always sending them the annotated notes and still ending with a low GPA. For example, last semester was tough for me and i failed to do well in a lot of my classes, i changed my study habits this semester and I’m doing better but they still make me feel like shit for it. Like the other day, I had gotten an exam mark back and did surprisingly well beyond my expectations, and of course my friend comes up to me and says “well you would be dumb not to do well, it was so easy.” Mind you, he has a 4.0 and i guess just understands things a lot faster than everyone else; i dont want to say he’s naturally smart but intelligence can be built onto with effort, but he’s definitely one has had an easier i me understanding things quicker. He’s always been kinda condescending, but deep down everything he says in regards to academics i feel like is true. My friends then continued to say that “oh you just got lucky” or “hope you can do as well on the final since that’s the important one,” just because i scored higher than me. This all has caused such a strain on mental health and feel as if I’m not smart enough for them or for this school. \n",
            "\n",
            "Alongside that, the relationship between my boyfriend and I are getting more and more distant as the days past which makes me feel like I’m not enough. We are long distance and have been dating for over a year now. He got accepted to university of Toronto, and so he moved there. I’m happy for him and I’m happy that he loves his program and what he’s doing, but is it selfish to wish for him to have stayed here instead. I know he was just looking out for himself and that i might just be something temporary in his life and so i dont want to hold him back. But the thing is, he’s being more and more distant. He tells me he’s busy and that he has other things to attend when in reality he’s just hanging out with friends. I don’t mind him hanging out friends at all, but i just dont understand why he won’t tell me. He also happens to be hanging out around a lot of girls and it makes me insecure. I see their pictures and realize how much prettier they are then me, and that’s when i start to overthink. I fee Iike I’m not enough for him, that he’s gonna move on and find someone better. He tells me not to worry, but my mind just wanders. He doesn’t reply to me for hours and the whole thing just takes a toll on my life and therefore i spend time studying to try and distract myself from the idea of wondering what he’s out doing. I mean, my boyfriend is definitely a good looking dude, even my friends say so themselves and he’s social, so he would have no problem just meeting new people. So sometimes, i really do feel like I’m just holding him back and that he cud do so much better in life. That’s really the only benefit out of this whole thing i guess. It also doesn’t help that i have trust issues since i got cheated on in my last relationship. My last boyfriend was sleeping with other girls while he was with me, in which i found out through a friend and one of the girls.

I have insecurities about my appearance and they know that, but they constantly bring it up to joke about, same with my weight. I am by no means overweight, but the jokes they make are so insensitive and make me feel like i need to eat less and constantly workout. I feel the need to cover up my insecurities with makeup and the need to allude nicer physical features to make up for the parts of me that are lacking. They say i have a good personality, yet they shit talk me to other people. They believe what others say when those people have never even met me. I feel Ike i can’t trust any of my friends because none of them really care and they always spill my secrets to whoever and whenever even when i tell them to keep it, it’s usually really personal matters that i dont want being spread around. Some of them only ever talk to me when they want to the gossip about my own life or other people.

I listen to everything they tell me to do and don’t get into trouble with the law or people in general. I dont go out very often and keep my health in check. I’m good with my money and even make sure to help around the house. They make me feel so insignificant and feel as if my life is worthless.

I dont expect her to throw me party or anything, but even asking to go out for dinner would have been nice. As for all my other friends, none of them even remembered until they saw a post that one of my friends made in regards to wishing me a happy birthday. So all of them texted me late at night, I’m not gonna assume tha it was because they saw the post, but their timing just made it seem like they all forgot. On top of that, my other best friends jus didn’t even bother to ask me if i wanted to do something or my birthday. I know that people are busy but there as a break right around that time, and it’s tradition that we go out and celebrate every time it’s someone’s birthday. Maybe I’m just not worthy of the tradition? I’m always the one to plan all these things out, but for once i just wanted them to do it for me? Is that too much to ask?\n",

At first I was happy to stay home with my family, even though I'm an extrovert and really enjoy social interaction.  Then I began getting lonely, my birthday was great but I had to cancel plans with my friends.  Gradually my friends stopped texting me - maybe just the random snap for streaks.  We make plans to watch movies but they watch without me or they bail.  Since quarantine, they only hmu to talk about their problems or if they are bored - if I mention a problem they ignore it.  I get really jealous from people posting their facetimes and stuff.  My main friends talk to me less than they used to.  Then a few of my high school friends started talking on the daily this week but I needed a break but I was too scared to end the conversation, because I thought they wouldn't hit me up back - so I kept talking and talking and it felt like I kept tripping over my own feet.  Then I ended the conversation abruptly, and I regret it but I just need a break from everything.  From the moment I wake up, I'm physically sick and stressed.

I am immensely lonely I don't know why: I live with my family and have friends that keep in touch.  It doesn't seem enough, and I hate feeling that way.  I went on dating apps just to find friends (no intention to date), but my matches didn't start the convo and when I did they didn't answer.  That made me feel lonelier.  There was one guy but the conversation was basically me apologizing for being interested in him (even platonically) because he wasn't interested back (not even as friends).  This is not me, I'm usually confident and happy, but I just feel really lonely and have no idea why.  I keep acting impulsively and doing stuff I never would.\n",

From age 14 to age 19, I was just unhappy.  I was never satisfied not because I thought nothing was enough but because I felt empty.

I thought I could just deal with it myself and I tried to act normal under a lot of mental stress but it would get very hard after a while and I couldn't take it and I'd do things I'd later regret. Like the double personality would kick in if I was even a little bit stressed or fearful, so that although I had the same memories, it would feel like someone else's memories and not like I was the one had lived through them, so I'd go from being really caring one moment to being cold and unfeeling the next time.

The thing is it's easy for me to make new friends they just don't last. Anyway, the first year was good until I reconnected with a friend that I was close with in junior high, she would always ask for notes and help in classes but I thought it was normal because I asked for help too. It seemed good, but she would make friends in front of me with our mutual friends and not invite me. She once brought a guy to study with us and we made small talk and since then she would always tell me to leave when they hung out or would skip her class to hang with him so I wouldn't be there. This used to happen in junior high and she had a boyfriend during that time, so I just brushed it off. Then I passed my midterm and I was talking to a mutual friend and he said she didn't: the next morning I wake up to a paragraph of her telling me that it was none of my business to know if she failed or not (even though I did not ask, he told me), and that I invaded her life, etc. She called me some names then blocked me on everything and the guys that hung out with her did the same. Then my closest friend at the time kept wanting to hang out over the summer, and I did make time for her but at that time my mum was out of the country and my sister was in the hospital so I was taking care of my younger brother and nephew. One time we made plans, but I told her ahead of time that I will be late because I had to take care of my nephew. I was on my way to meet her when I couldn't find my nephew and had to go look for him in all of his friends' houses - still, I let her know. I was about half an hour late and when I showed up, I couldn't find her because she left and didn't even tell me, another friend let me know. She stopped talking to me for two years.

So I’ve been a good student for the majority of my life, I’m usually the top of my class and it was a rare occasion that I ever got a grade below a 90 that wasn’t Language Arts. But lately, i’ve been having some issues with my mental health, unresolved issues that i’m not exactly even sure how to solve yet. Amongst other more personal things, it’s caused me to lose the motivation to do anything at all. I just continue to see my grades drop, feeling helpless even when I know all I have to do is to actually start doing assignments. I won’t get into much detail with what’s going on with that but it’s basically caused me to have had a bunch of missing assignments. My tests, i still do decently on which is the only thing keeping my grades alive. My first semester ended and it’s ranging from 70-80 for my final grades. My parents are really disappointed in me and have started telling me to give up completely on even going to any university at all. Do I really have absolutely no chance anymore??? What if I can start to pick up my slack on the second semester and grade 12? Will this first semester really determine whether or not I’ll be able to go to university. I’m already starting to seek mental help and I’m going to force myself to build the habits to be productive day one of the second semester and am having some friends to monitor me in doing so. Please help me out, if this did just absolutely ruin my chances what can I do to fix it? I’m really scared for my future now\n",

I think it all started when covid started. My friend and I barely talked online lol… it wasn’t a big deal. I was just not used to it. My friend and I would text each other about our day, rant about homework, teachers…I had lots of friends, but she’s the only one I could talk to about my crush, life, family, depressed thoughts lmao… yeah… 2020 was our grad year too. I knew we were walking in different directions after grad… she even gave me a card on my birthday… A long message… there was a part about us going in different directions which made me cry a lot… whole night. I didn’t expect us to grow apart a lot though. I took a gap year. I started uni fall 2021. It was sad cause I had no one to tell about my day or my crush or how bad the professors are or how burnt out I am or how my grades are low or I got a 90 or something on an exam. Around beginning of January 2022, I had those midnight thoughts and thought about her. I texted her a whole paragraph took me a whole hour cause I was crying. She replied the next day, she asked if I was okay. I felt that she cared… but I didn’t feel it anymore… the spark of our friendship. That day I realized that we REALLY grew apart. I was hurt actually. Anyways since that day social media has been giving me signs about some people are meant to stay and some are meant to leave … I decided that I should stop holding on to the past. I was doing well until today. I visited my junior high school. One of the teachers told me to say hi to her (aka my friend). I couldn’t tell her that we barely talk anymore. So I am now thinking about my friend again. Writing this post, crying. I know she has reddit, but I don’t know if she follows this reddit. Anyways, if she is… I want to tell you that I miss you. I can’t bring myself to text you because it’ll just break my heart knowing that we’ll only exchange few messages then not talk again. Still praying that you achieve your dreams. n 3^o7 !\n",
