New Years. I wish you all a happy new years. Learn from your successes and failures in this last year, and use the latter to motivate you in the coming year. Its a new year and this brings with it new opportunities and possibilities. \n\nGood luck! \n\nIll see u at Prive today ;)","1":"This is how lonely i am.. Happy new year.","2":"This is how lonely i am.. Happy new year.","3":"How to deal with one sided friendships?. i am the type of person who puts others first (more than i probably should). i always make myself available when my friends need me, i never break commitments, remember birthdays and special events, etc. yet, i always feel very hurt and upset when people don\u2019t reciprocate this gesture or treat me with the same level of respect. \n\nfor instance, i have this one friend whom i met in uni. we are in different programs so we never see each other that often; nevertheless, i try my best to maintain that friendship. the problem is, whenever I text this friend, i usually feel anxious because i am never sure when this individual will respond back. like i greeted this friend this holiday season but i didn\u2019t even get a response back which feels like a slap in the face since the holiday season is now over. the thing is, i know this friend has been online (liking our mutual friends\u2019 posts on instagram and facebook). i know the instance this individual texts back, i will respond asap. it is this endless cycle where my feelings are never heard which bothers me. \n\nmy one concern is that I\u2019m compromising my own wellbeing for the sake of keeping this friendship alive. every time i feel hurt by someone abusing my good nature, i always tell myself not to confront them, just wait it out and act like it\u2019s no big deal and get the friendship back.\n\ndoes anyone else do this? has confrontation ever worked? any advice would be appreciated!","4":"Escape reality. Sometimes I just wanna say f this and fly to some obscure jungle and live my own life. \n\nBut I'm gonna die in Day 2 while trying to roast a fruit so Im stuck here for now.","5":"Slow Decline. **&gt; Long post about my personal mental health ahead, just looking for some advice.**\n\n  \nI'm not really happy with my exam marks. I've done so much better in the past, and don't really know what's going on. I remember first semester, first year I was doing really well, genuinely enjoying my courses, and going to class.   \n\n\nNow my problem is I'm sleeping more than 10h every night, and during the semester I couldn't wake myself up to go to class, I have no motivation to do my assignments, and its just a general struggle.  \nThis year, I started taking medication for ADHD again after a long while of not having it, but it has yet to help much. I recently switched medications over this winter break, so we'll see how that goes, but I doubt it will be life-changing, as clearly my problem is something deeper.  \n\n\nI'm currently staying on-campus. I'm not sure whether or not this living situation has benefits or drawbacks towards my working life. Honestly it just feels like I don't have time to do anything because I leave everything for the last minute, and relaxation is just stressful because I really could be doing something productive instead. I just ended up feeling so overwhelmed  I couldn't get anything done.   \n\n\nWhat's the best way for me to get back on my feet? My work ethic in high-school and first year were so much better than right now. I just don't know where to start.","6":"I'm so tired. How was everybody's first day back?","7":"I know UWS is usually slow to start the semester, but does it seem like it's been incredibly slow even by first week standards?. \\^","8":"Dont be that person. Stand on the right side\nwalk\/run on the right","9":"Lonely af. I\u2019m in first year second semester, and I feel totally lonely and isolated on campus. I don\u2019t live in res, and though I have a few friends from high school to spend my weekends with it\u2019s hard going to campus everyday and being completely alone. All my classes have been fairly large lectures where it\u2019s almost impossible to meet people, with the exception of a couple in which I\u2019ve only made casual acquaintances. I feel like this is supposed to be a fun and exciting stage in my life, but instead it\u2019s draining and isolated. Anyone else in the same position\/have advice?","10":"When they posted the homework a week ago and you procrastinated. ","11":"I don't think I'm cut out for University. I loved it when I first got here and didn't have too much trouble. I did my work and went to class, I had friends I would spend time with, I got fine grades, overall I was pretty content. Then everything took a turn after a few months and one stupid fucking thing that I could have prevented if I had just been more observant and less idiotic began a domino effect and my fast decline into being a horrible student, I was fucking miserable, I had trouble with my work no matter how much I would study, definitely wouldnt go to class enough, I completely closed myself off and wouldn't spend time with anyone, it was rare if u would eat at all, wouldn't get out of bed, got sick, slept too much or not at all, had shit hygiene, wouldn't clean and all that stuff is still happening to this day. It all came came to a head this past week, I had a deferred exam I know I failed which effects my classes this semester and my program as a whole and I can't even get advising time because the advisor i need is booked past the swap\/drop date. It also made me realise just how unready I am for every class I am in, it's just a matter of time before i fail those too. I have never even thought of a future where I don't graduate from university in this field but I'm not smart or strong enough to handle it or anything else. I'm watching my entire world fall apart because I couldn't even handle my first semester where I spent so much time justifying my lack of accomplishment and being all alone to stupid life events that made me depressed, I wouldnt make myself grow up and get kn with my life like I should have. I know that people will say this isn't the end of the world and doesn't mean university is over but ever single plan I had is ruined, I can't get help in time and if I did they would probably tell me everything I already know, i have no backup plans and continuing my current courses will be nothing but wasting more money than I already have to pretend i could ever get this degree in the first place.","12":"Quick reminder, watch out for your own mental health and that of your friends, family, and loved ones.. It's that time of year when winters been going on for too long, the sun doesn't shine, it's too cold, and school is getting stressful again. It's a time of year to watch out for each other and especially a time to talk to someone if you're concerned about them at all. Happy studies and rest of the year everybody!","13":"Dear former best friend. ...I miss you.\n\nYou were an amazing friend to me, however we both hurt each other and now I don\u2019t know if you want to see me again. Regardless, I realize dropping you as a friend was a stupid mistake I made and a price I have to pay.\n\nRight now, I am not going through the best things right now, so I wish I had more friends to support me. And I see you in Humanities all the time and see you post on Reddit and it hurts and makes me remind me of the time we were best friends and my heart hurts whenever I run into you in person.

Opinions needed.. I know this may not be the most appropriate thread but I really need to vent about this situation because it\u2019s been bothering me for a while and I have no one else to talk to.\nI moved into off-campus student residence this fall so this has been my first time living with someone other than family. And me and my roommate were randomly assigned.Feel free to tell me if I\u2019m in the wrong , again I want a third party opinion.\n\nWhen  we moved in we had sets of rules and agreements that we talked about and I feel like she has broken every Agreement!! I wish I could  explain every one but this post will be too long so I will explain the dealbreaker.\nWhen we moved in, we agreed that when we invite guest over we would let the other person know. That only lasted a couple months. Recently she has been inviting people over all the time without telling me and I find it really rude. I pay to live here and out of respect I would like to know when someone is going to be in the dorm( my dorm is literally so small so it\u2019s also kinda awkward when a bunch of strangers are right outside your door) . One time she even had a little attitude because she was trying to bring people over (again without giving me a heads up) and I was home.?? Like it\u2019s so ridiculous. Most of the time the guests are in her room but I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t just let me know when she\u2019s bringing someone over, especially when it\u2019s a guy spending the night. Lately she has been bringing guys over to spend the night and again no heads up. I just always feel uncomfortable being at home because I\u2019m always self conscious about what I wear etc. because I never know who is coming over.\nThe last straw is I planned to come home and sleep early because I have a midterm tomorrow and I got home around  11PM from the library. And she has another guest spending the night , talking and laughing VERY loudly  at 12AM , as I type right now.\nI\u2019m planning on talking to the manager and asking to switch rooms because I am really fed up. I am not upset because she has guests  because she lives here she can invite whoever she wants but I just feel completely disrespected. I don\u2019t even care to talk to her about it because she clearly  just doesn\u2019t care. And if you knew the other things she\u2019s done it\u2019s obvious that she is just inconsiderate.

I talk to friends, eat, and cry. It works. What do you guys do?","28":"To my fellow UofA students. There have been a few sad posts on here lately, and I know these people are not the only ones feeling down.  To the girls and guys who are getting their heartbroken and left, to the students dealing with mental illness, to the students with no friends, the students who have a family member\/friend that is sick, the student who can't afford to eat, the student who feels too stupid to be at school and all the rest;  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have every fucking right to be determined, to feel worthy of yourself and stand your ground.   The world is not a beautiful place, it just appears that way, it is conditioned by abandonment and giving up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose we want to love we leave us, and when they go we feel they take pieces of our worth away, guess what? NO ONE can take your worth away. No one has the fucking right to come to swoon you and take pieces of you away, and you are whole all of you, the only thing that is leaving is an opportunity someone was too cowardly to take. Or maybe, you reflect rejection onto yourself and wonder and all the things you could have done differently, perhaps they don't see it that way, maybe they aren't feeling well and don't know how to express it, so they walk away. Maybe people have different kinds of eyes and see beauty in different places, and for some people, your beauty is so rare it takes the most unique pair of eyes to find you.   But that's not all. It doesn't make things better, not when they tell you 'others will come, 'you are still young,' or '(he or she) is not a good person' no that doesn't make it better. You need to know that while things, opportunities and people are leaving you and walking away, YOU are still here not giving up, YOU ARE BEING STRONG. Stand your ground and know you have every right to take up space in this world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n When you are struggling with mental illness, when you can't stop re-arranging your room, throwing up, thinking about pills...when you are onto another depressive\/manic episode you are not alone. The world wants you to quit, it almost expects you too, but FUCK that. We have our seasons, and sometimes they go on forever, you hate yourself for things you cannot always control, believe that everything is your fault and that it was a mistake you got into university, every time you reject these thoughts you get stronger. It is not your fault, each time you stand your ground and tell yourself you are not leaving, that you made it to university, equally like everyone else. This is how you get stronger. You show yourself that with every goodbye, and with every challenge, you were the one who chose to stay and even if you can't or if you already have left remember there is a place you know you can always come back too.   To the people who hate their bodies, I don't know who many times I hear people commenting on how fat they feel. You have EVERY RIGHT to eat, go to the vending machine and get a chocolate bar right now.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd by the way, to those assholes that kept calling this other student 'stupid,' screw you. You don't say, 'ignore him he's dumb' or 'how did he get into university he's so stupid.' That's not a joke; it's not funny.  It's the reason why people end up feeling so shitty about themselves and depressed. I don't care if they are laughing too, you can see it behind their eyes you took it too far.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the students out there who have lost loved ones, or parents. I know how it feels to do this alone, to graduate from high school and walk off the stage with a diploma expecting your mom to be in the audience but she isn't. While everyone is throwing their caps in the air, your throat swells. When everyone is cheering for someone, and you just want that person to be there cheering for you. Like when you got accepted to the university or got a good mark on an exam. You sit in your room crying.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut I can still say, *'look, Mom, I did it.'*   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is an emotional, sad overly dramatic post and probably full of errors, but I wanted to say something.

So it might just be a better idea to deal with a temporary minor inconvenience. Sometime's it's just nice to vent your frustrations out and it's always nice to know other people have been in your situation. I feel like people who jump on these kinds of posts are being hypocritical in a way - it's way easier to tell someone off online because there isn't a face connected with our accounts here.\n\nThis subreddit doesn't move super fast anyway so it's not like those types of threads are taking up any real estate in the long run.

I guarantee it. \n\nIf you attempt talking to the girl\/guy you find attractive you have already improved your chances from 100% never being with them. Sure, they might reject you but you are CERTAIN to be rejected if you refuse to talk to them. **POSTING YOUR FEELINGS ON REDDIT WILL GET YOU 0 GIRLS\/GUYS.** \n\nAlso, not everyone are assholes at this school. If some random person approached me at school i would be polite. Sure, I might not want to have a 30 minute discussion with them but I will engage with them. Sure, some people might be assholes but fuck them!!! :) move onto the next one. \n\nAnyways, stop doubting yourself and overthinking bullshit. If you see someone who looks cute go talk to them.

I'm not that socially awkward or anything but I feel like I've been rejected by my peers so many times, especially when I was younger, so I'm too afraid to attempt to make friends.. It's this weird thing where I want friends but at the same time I'm too scared to fully open up to people. i never really feel like I'm fully being myself because I'm afraid they're going to hurt me in some way. it's kind of pathetic but it's really difficult especially on the weekends and stuff when I see all these people going out with their friends - not that I have that great of a desire to go out or anything, but just seeing the company and relationships that other people have makes me feel really sad.

So, I am not very punctual about arriving to his class on time or regularly. He has an extremely thick, nigh impossible to understand (for me) African accent, so I skip his classes and spend the time reading the notes and textbook, and when I do arrive, usually around ten minutes late since he spends the first ten minutes talking about random shit anyways, I sit at the back, on the end of the row, not disturbing anyone. He even leaves the door open so I wouldn't even be disturbing his class by opening a door. I always quietly unpack my things and I am not friends with anyone in the class so it's not like I'm chatting people up once I sit down.\n\nToday he called me out on arriving late and skipping two classes in a row, in front of the whole class, pausing his entire lecture to point me out so everyone would turn to look at me. I didn't say anything since I felt rebuffing him would just give him more shit to use against me, so I just sat there in silence.\n\nIt was really embarrassing for someone who arrives late 99% of the time and doesn't get noticed because I make a point to stay unnoticed.

I kind of want to, but I don't have a valid excuse other than \"I can't understand him\" and I feel like administration won't accept that.\n\nShould I just suck it up since it's almost the end of the semester? \n\nI just want to know....","262":"Sorry I have no one to talk to.

I was great. I still find it great. The thing is, I have two groups of friends that I'm really close with and before university, I would only ever see them separately as they were from different areas of my life but now that we are in university together, I see both groups of people at the same place at the same time. It's not like they don't get along or anything, but merging both groups of friends just really isn't an option. I'm really the only thing they have in common so when I've tried that in the past, we always end up in awkward silence. \n\nMy issue is that I'm constantly having to chose one group over the other. On weekends, on breaks between classes, parties, etc. When I get invited to hang out by both groups, the timing often overlap so I constantly feel like I'm blowing one group off for the other and I hate that. I don't want to lose either group of people, maybe I just have a problem telling people no and this isn't really that big of a deal, I don't know. Nonetheless, this issue has been making me feel like I'm being an absolutely horrible friend to both groups.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice\/experience with this issue?

I rarely see my friends and I cancel plans but tbh I don't wanna see them because after hanging out I come home drained.

Whenever I go to the gym, I see people doing stuff that could be detrimental to their body and bones. It bugs me cause you can tell they are just starting out and having gotten so much help when I started out I feel any obligation to help them.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure whether that's something people at university are fine with or if they would be annoyed.\n\nLMK your thoughts..","375":"Feeling like I\u2019ve hit rock bottom. This year has been tough and it just got a whole lot worse.\n\nThe transition from high school to university was hard, the work ethic difference was huge and I was in no way ready for it. But something about it all has just just really put me in an all time low and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the cause, quite possibly is just everything being pushed onto me all at once. Let\u2019s start off with the feelings I have of being completely empty on the inside. I go day by day with nothing to look forward to really, and even when i do, they just seem like they are dull and boring. I go to school everyday, go to classes, interact with some people, go home, study, eat, sleep, and repeat. It\u2019s a continuous cycle that is dull and lacks any really excitement but is required. Now i understand that i could change things up a bit and hang out with some friends, but the problem is that they never want to hang out. All my friends prioritize everything else in there life and other people in their life more than me. For example, my best friend, every time i ask her to hang out, she always tells me that she wants to go home early, and on the days that she doesn\u2019t, she always reserve them for her boyfriend. She barely replies to my text cause she\u2019s always hanging out with her boyfriend and it gets kinda annoying. Every time she invites me to hang out with them, i always end up declining because I feel so unwelcome. Like the whole third wheeling feeling is horrible but when it\u2019s with them, it\u2019s on a whole other level, they are always secretive and laughing about things and never talk about things that allow me to join in on conversation. As for my other friends, they are always hanging out with their other friend groups and i never get invited, or they go to different schools and find it too bothersome to arrange time to meet up with me. I feel like everyone has their people and I\u2019m jut left in the shadows where i am left alone. On top of that, it always feels like a competition with all my friends, to see who can do the best. I understand that university is strongly built on being the best and getting the best results, but i feel so stupid compared to them, they all have 4.0 GPAs with minimal effort and dont even show up to class and I\u2019m stuck always sending them the annotated notes and still ending with a low GPA. For example, last semester was tough for me and i failed to do well in a lot of my classes, i changed my study habits this semester and I\u2019m doing better but they still make me feel like shit for it. Like the other day, I had gotten an exam mark back and did surprisingly well beyond my expectations, and of course my friend comes up to me and says \u201cwell you would be dumb not to do well, it was so easy.\u201d Mind you, he has a 4.0 and i guess just understands things a lot faster than everyone else; i dont want to say he\u2019s naturally smart but intelligence can be built onto with effort, but he\u2019s definitely one has had an easier i me understanding things quicker. He\u2019s always been kinda condescending, but deep down everything he says in regards to academics i feel like is true. My friends then continued to say that \u201coh you just got lucky\u201d or \u201chope you can do as well on the final since that\u2019s the important one,\u201d just because i scored higher than me. This all has caused such a strain on mental health and feel as if I\u2019m not smart enough for them or for this school. \n\nAlongside that, the relationship between my boyfriend and I are getting more and more distant as the days past which makes me feel like I\u2019m not enough. We are long distance and have been dating for over a year now. He got accepted to university of Toronto, and so he moved there. I\u2019m happy for him and I\u2019m happy that he loves his program and what he\u2019s doing, but is it selfish to wish for him to have stayed here instead. I know he was just looking out for himself and that i might just be something temporary in his life and so i dont want to hold him back. But the thing is, he\u2019s being more and more distant. He tells me he\u2019s busy and that he has other things to attend when in reality he\u2019s just hanging out with friends. I don\u2019t mind him hanging out friends at all, but i just dont understand why he won\u2019t tell me. He also happens to be hanging out around a lot of girls and it makes me insecure. I see their pictures and realize how much prettier they are then me, and that\u2019s when i start to overthink. I fee Iike I\u2019m not enough for him, that he\u2019s gonna move on and find someone better. He tells me not to worry, but my mind just wanders. He doesn\u2019t reply to me for hours and the whole thing just takes a toll on my life and therefore i spend time studying to try and distract myself from the idea of wondering what he\u2019s out doing. I mean, my boyfriend is definitely a good looking dude, even my friends say so themselves and he\u2019s social, so he would have no problem just meeting new people. So sometimes, i really do feel like I\u2019m just holding him back and that he cud do so much better in life. That\u2019s really the only benefit out of this whole thing i guess. It also doesn\u2019t help that i have trust issues since i got cheated on in my last relationship. My last boyfriend was sleeping with other girls while he was with me, in which i found out through a friend and one of the girls. That was devastating to me as he broke up with me before i found out and said that he couldn\u2019t be with me due to him just losing feelings and that I just wasn\u2019t what he wanted anymore.  \nThat made me completely insecure. My friends just add to the fire cause they always \u201ctease\u201d me about my looks and my weight. I have insecurities about my appearance and they know that, but they constantly bring it up to joke about, same with my weight. I am by no means overweight, but the jokes they make are so insensitive and make me feel like i need to eat less and constantly workout. I feel the need to cover up my insecurities with makeup and the need to allude nicer physical features to make up for the parts of me that are lacking. They say i have a good personality, yet they shit talk me to other people. They believe what others say when those people have never even met me. I feel Ike i can\u2019t trust any of my friends because none of them really care and they always spill my secrets to whoever and whenever even when i tell them to keep it, it\u2019s usually really personal matters that i dont want being spread around. Some of them only ever talk to me when they want to the gossip about my own life or other people. I have a hard time trusting people because i was continuously backstabbed in high school and lost so many friends because of it. Maybe I\u2019m just problematic \n\nI get zero support from my parents and they always complain about how I\u2019m always acting so stressed about school and that me crying over my friendships is stupid and dumb. They say i dont have any real friends or dont have any at all because of my shitty personality. That i bring so much problems into their life when in reality i am a really good kid. I listen to everything they tell me to do and don\u2019t get into trouble with the law or people in general. I dont go out very often and keep my health in check. I\u2019m good with my money and even make sure to help around the house. They make me feel so insignificant and feel as if my life is worthless. It\u2019s only whenever i have a mental breakdown that they show some empathy, but it all seems fake. \n\nLastly, i know this is stupid but the ting that really made me feel so insignificant and unimportant was my best friend forgetting that it was my birthday. Weeks passed my and she just never said it to me, she didn\u2019t even remember let alone ask to go out for food. I dont expect her to throw me party or anything, but even asking to go out for dinner would have been nice. As for all my other friends, none of them even remembered until they saw a post that one of my friends made in regards to wishing me a happy birthday. So all of them texted me late at night, I\u2019m not gonna assume tha it was because they saw the post, but their timing just made it seem like they all forgot. On top of that, my other best friends jus didn\u2019t even bother to ask me if i wanted to do something or my birthday. I know that people are busy but there as a break right around that time, and it\u2019s tradition that we go out and celebrate every time it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday. Maybe I\u2019m just not worthy of the tradition? I\u2019m always the one to plan all these things out, but for once i just wanted them to do it for me? Is that too much to ask?\n\nI don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m just being dramatic :\/","376":"I'm so tired of the \"getting to know people\" phase.

I think a lot of these posts always say how the uni doesn\u2019t care for mental health and to some extent I totally agree but this is a situation when they\u2019re putting students mental health first and instead of appreciating that, you\u2019re fighting it. They know that the fact there\u2019s a pandemic really stresses everyone out and they\u2019re trying to reduce that by taking away just another stressor on your plate right now... idk maybe it\u2019s just me.

I thought I'd try and find the positive in things, by working really really hard at school and trying to get a 4.0 this semester (I have a 3.7 right now cause I've busted my ass). That's not useful anymore because it's a credit\/non-credit system now. Nothing in my life is going right and I see no point in trying in anything anymore (school, my mental health) and that I should just give up, relapse and let the grades I worked so hard to get drop, cause as long as it's over a 50%, I still pass.","464":"Let\u2019s look at the big picture here.. Yes. It sucks that you put a lot of effort in this semester to boost your GPA, and it sucks that that effort will be going unnoticed. It sucks and you are more than entitled to be upset. Take your time to be pissed off and when you\u2019re ready, keep reading.\n\nNow we have acknowledged that this is a shitty situation. Right now everyone around the world is in a shitty situation and is upset because of things being cancelled, losing their job, being inconvenienced, and having things around them change.\n\nThis is probably the first time in my life I have seen that everyone in the world is in the same boat. We are all scared, anxious, and unprepared. This is a GLOBAL pandemic.\n\nThis is not about you and your grades, this is about doing the right thing and that\u2019s what the university is trying to do. \n\nAt the end of the day. Your GPA is not gonna get worse, and realistically unless you got all A\u2019s this semester and you don\u2019t usually, it\u2019s not going to get better.\n\nI think people are really missing the big picture here. This is an incredibly unique situation, and the university has made a decision that they believe will be best for the most number of students. \n\nBe a little bit more compassionate to the people who are not going to do well this semester because of this situation.\n\nI do believe that pass\/fail should be optional, but it\u2019s less fair to have people\u2019s GPA go down because of an event they had literally no control over than have everyone\u2019s GPA\u2019s completely unaffected because of this pandemic.\n\nIn short, your grades are not more important than a global pandemic and it\u2019s time to get perspective on what\u2019s happening here. This is a time for the community to come together, not turn against each other because of something so trivial.

I don't care what your opinion about this situation regarding dido295 is but I just wanna remind you that he's a person with feelings too and an active user of this subreddit at that.\n\n He's had a past that's not the best one around. This doesn't mean that he doesn't get hurt the way you would when there's a complete subreddit going off on a witch hunt for you, the tipping reason being you doing the job that you're supposed to be doing. I am not saying that what he did with the snitching and the stuff that radilia mentioned earlier is right or even justified but I've known him personally for a long time and I can see how he may seem like not the nicest person based on his internet activity but he is a pretty genuine person when you get to know him and I am pretty sure all of this is getting to him. It'd  get to anyone.\n\nSo all I am requesting from y'all right now is don't form your opinion about a person without having met him and interacted with him in person.

You got to treat yourself right because the better you treat yourself, the better your life will be. And the better your relationships will be too because if you know how to treat yourself, you'll know how to treat others. From my experience.\n\nBackstory (warning, it's a bit sad):\nCurrently in a relationship, I started putting a lot of strain on it because I wouldn't just relax, take things as they come, instead I got more and more stressed and afraid and I forced myself, kept pushing myself. The more harsh I was on myself the harder it became to be as  compassionate and kind as I should have been in the relationship.\nOn top of that I have some serious mental health\/mental issues, I could say a lot more but I won't go into details (one of them is having a double personality), that got worse over time and I wasn't open and honest about that. I didn't even tell him. I kind of thought I wasn't supposed to. I thought I could just deal with it myself and I tried to act normal under a lot of mental stress but it would get very hard after a while and I couldn't take it and I'd do things I'd later regret. Like the double personality would kick in if I was even a little bit stressed or fearful, so that although I had the same memories, it would feel like someone else's memories and not like I was the one had lived through them, so I'd go from being really caring one moment to being cold and unfeeling the next time. Looking back I can see it must feel horrible to be treated that way by someone you really care about, and I hate that I put him through that. \nWhy didn't I just say these things in the first place, so that he knew I was struggling and that it wasn't because of him. Why wasn't I more truthful. I was afraid of saying the wrong things or that it would hurt him even more, or that it would have some random unknown effect. \nEven without knowing any of this he was kind and forgiving way beyond anyone I've ever known.","529":"I hate U of C.

So I\u2019m seeing a lot of posts talking about how atrocious and hard online learning and school is but am I the only person who genuinely prefers it? Adhd ruins my time management so I\u2019m late pretty often and GAD a lot of the time makes it so even if I\u2019m only 10 min to class, I have to pick between legitimate anxiety attack or no class that day. That being said I heavily relied on either my friends in class helping me with notes, hoping the professor would be a little gracious at my difficulties, and cramming from the text book. This also just made it really hard to even wanna go to class or try to stay caught up on lectures, and I\u2019ve been in the habit of learning whole classes from the text book in a week; in lesser words, I was scraping by the skin of my teeth and always extremely anxious and on edge because of my own faults. \nThis semester though? Online has made it so that not only can I sit at home and do all my work without ever being anxious about missing stuff and timing, but I csn learn in class and from the process because it\u2019s just me and a screen not 400 other heart beats and shufflings. I\u2019ve managed to start going to gym 3-4 times a week for the first time since highschool and I think that stems from not being so stressed about actually being at school. \nHonestly typing it out, im kinda re\u00e0lizing its less the online format and more so the fact my anxiety and stress has been reduced 100fold that leaves a lot more of my brain free but \nTLDR: anyone else finding online school is helping them more than hindering, especially with some aspects relating to dealing w symptoms of mental health?","616":"First Year Online.

Don't get me wrong some aspects of online are way better than in person but overall it sucks for me.

Last year was my first year of uni and things were looking up for me. In the last couple months I have truly hit rock bottom. I cry multiple times a day, I don\u2019t sleep, have no appetite or motivation to do anything. I have to force myself to do everyday tasks like showering and changing my clothes. I haven\u2019t been outside in almost a week. I have zero friends. Nobody to talk to. I\u2019m more of an introverted person so at first i loved online school back in April, but i\u2019ve now realized that the only thing that kept me sane was being forced to have a routine; getting up early to drive to school, getting myself ready to look presentable to others, seeing people on campus, being in a classroom feeling like I belong, etc. I\u2019m truly rotting from the inside and dont know how much longer of this I can take. Hearing that winter 2021 and possibly even fall 2021 is going to be online sent me into a panic because if I\u2019m this bad now, I fear what my life will look like in a few months.

So, I realized this year that I cannot stop comparing myself to other people. It has been nerve-wreaking because I always see myself falling short. Everyone just seems so much better than me.

This year, I\u2019ve felt anxious many times simply because I think I\u2019m disappointing my parents or my friends are going to all be successful while I will be a failure.

I've been seeing a lot of posts of people saying that online school isn't going well for them or that they just have other problems going on in their lives and are overwhelmed. Whether it's because of school, family, friends, relationship, or anything else that may be bothering you... keep your head up! You'll make it through this.\n\nI did terribly last semester and by terrible i mean TERRIBLE. This year has been going better for me. Maybe this year isn't going too well for you... **YET.** \n\nThing WILL get better for you! I'm sure many of us are having a hard time adjusting to the different 'school' environment. You aren't alone.\n\nMaybe some of these things that help me when I'm down will help you:\n\n1. Talk to someone. It's simple. If you have a family member, a friend, or even a pet... letting all your feeling out may help you.\n2. Listen to some music. Something that can hype you up? Or if you're studying, maybe some lo-fi or orchestral music.\n3. Try playing a game. I play games all the time (maybe too much), but try playing a quick game that isn't too distracting. I've been taking care of a virtual plant (game is called **viridi**) and I take a few minutes of my time to water it everyday. \n4. Draw, write, or just scribble something on paper.\n5. If you play an instrument, maybe find a song that you like and try learning it.\n6. Get up and walk around. Look outside. This is mostly to rest your eyes. Sometimes when I'm looking at my monitor or a screen for too long I tend to lose focus.\n\nThese may not work for you. But they are some of the things **I** do when I'm feeling down.\n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to, I'm all ears (or eyes). I'm sure there are many people who are also open to talk. Maybe you'll make a new friend :). \n\nLastly, to those who think life isn't worth living, there are many things to live for. Our brains tend to focus on the negatives. The positives may just be hiding from you. What I realized is that when I talk to someone about my problems, they tend to point out some positives that I may have overlooked.\n\nRemember, take a break from studying. Even if you have a midterm or a test the next day, take a few minutes to get up and walk around. Get some water. Pat your dog's head. \n\nYou can do it!","635":"Not cool STATS 235 team... Not cool..

I think I'm just wasting money. \n\nThing is I just... don't know if withdrawing from all my classes is the right thing to do. The thought of it makes me feel like a huge failure. I feel like I'm not giving myself a chance, but I also know how disappointed my parents would be if I went home right now and told them I'm depressed and riddled with mental issues and I don't know what to do with myself. I used to be so ambitious and driven, and I would hate for them to see me be at such a low point that I can't even take care of myself properly anymore. Plus I have no plan for the year off.

But with how my studies are going right now (about to get 2 Fs at this rate), I am just about reaching my limits. I love my degree of choice. I really want to spend time at the faculty that constantly guides me to make a better version of myself. I hate that I can't even force myself to study knowing very well I will fail if I don't focus.

Ever since online school started, I can\u2019t bring myself to sit and focus on my schoolwork for longer than 20 minutes, and that\u2019s not an exaggeration. After about 15-20 mins, my mind starts wandering, i start fidgeting and staring into space and without even realizing it, 30 minutes have passed of me doing absolutely nothing. It\u2019s exhausting because it takes me so long to study. For instance, I have been studying the same Chapter from the same class for 2 days now. It\u2019s not even just with schoolwork, I can\u2019t even focus on things I enjoy; I can\u2019t even watch TV anymore because I can\u2019t focus on the plot and I can\u2019t sit still.

","696":"I'm scared that my life will stay the same. I decided to make this post instead of continuing crying at 4 am.\n\nI am tired of being stuck in the same circle. I'm in my 4th year and my life is the same as it was when I was a bullied little girl in elementary school. Back in elementary school, I was bullied, no one would show up to my birthday, I was sexually harassed by my best friend - yes in elementary school, and when I moved I used to get emails from the same girl telling me what everyone was saying about me. She would email me all the awful things they said behind my back.\n\nFast forward to junior high, it was a bit better but I was one of the very few visible minorities so I face a lot of discrimination by students and staff. Additionally, I was ostracized and people who I thought were my friends would ignore me for weeks and spread rumors.\n\nHigh school was better, I was still discriminated against but it was less. There was less drama and I made a lot of friends. I was used by a few people to get a good grade but overall high school was good.\n\nIn university, I thought it would get better. After all, it's huge and no one really has time for drama. I just kept to myself. As usual, I made new friends and connected with old ones. The thing is it's easy for me to make new friends they just don't last. Anyway, the first year was good until I reconnected with a friend that I was close with in junior high, she would always ask for notes and help in classes but I thought it was normal because I asked for help too. It seemed good, but she would make friends in front of me with our mutual friends and not invite me. She once brought a guy to study with us and we made small talk and since then she would always tell me to leave when they hung out or would skip her class to hang with him so I wouldn't be there. This used to happen in junior high and she had a boyfriend during that time, so I just brushed it off. Then I passed my midterm and I was talking to a mutual friend and he said she didn't: the next morning I wake up to a paragraph of her telling me that it was none of my business to know if she failed or not (even though I did not ask, he told me), and that I invaded her life, etc. She called me some names then blocked me on everything and the guys that hung out with her did the same. Then my closest friend at the time kept wanting to hang out over the summer, and I did make time for her but at that time my mum was out of the country and my sister was in the hospital so I was taking care of my younger brother and nephew. One time we made plans, but I told her ahead of time that I will be late because I had to take care of my nephew. I was on my way to meet her when I couldn't find my nephew and had to go look for him in all of his friends' houses - still, I let her know. I was about half an hour late and when I showed up, I couldn't find her because she left and didn't even tell me, another friend let me know. She stopped talking to me for two years. I ended up breaking the silence because it got too awkward.\n\nIn the second year, there was a lot of talk behind my back in my friend group but it didn't bother me because by that point I learned to be more confident. I just spent less time with them. Second-year was my best. They would make friends and not invite me, and when I confronted them they would tell me things like we didn't think you'd be interested.\n\nIn my third year, I made a few new friends. Three of them would only text me when they needed something and ignore me for days. One of them would always get mad at me if I ask him why he leaves me on read and would get really mad when I would disagree with something he said. He would always get mad about little things and every time I took time away from him, he would come around and pretend to care about me. We also had mutual friends and were in the same club, but he would not acknowledge me in public only over text or study if it was just us two.\n\nFast forward to this year, I was made fun of every single time I met up with my volunteering group. I would be the center of every joke and anytime I tried to stand up to myself they would play the victim card and turn on me even more. They humiliated me in private and publically on social media. Yesterday, I reached out to a friend to vent out my frustrations and he basically said I deserve it.\n\nI'm NOT looking for sympathy, so please don't. I just wanted to let this out because I'm tired of this pattern, if you know me I tend to be outspoken and confident but I always feel bad about hurting someone's feelings so I tend to walk on eggs shells making sure what I say isn't offensive. I wouldn't say I'm nice but I do try to treat people with respect. So I don't understand why this happens to me and I don't want this to be the trend for my life. I hate how people can just throw away my friendship on something so stupid like missing a hangout or passing a midterm - am I not worth anything to them? I'm graduating and basically, I am terrified of this being my life.\n\nThank you for reading this and I'm sorry for bumming anyone out!

Dear person reading this:\n\nYou made it! 2020 was a long, confusing and difficult year but despite all of that, you are here! You made it through exams and you can finally take a breath and relax. If your grades aren\u2019t what you\u2019re used to, THATS OK, you\u2019ve had to learn an essentially new way to study and prepare for every exam.

But lately I've been struggling to feel like a functioning human being. Most of the time I have this feeling of emptiness in my mind. I am demotivated and lack... feeling(?) about things that should make me feel happy, sad, or even angry - as though I have no direction\/purpose and am just floating through life.

I moved out for university and am living with a couple of roommates. I already feel really burnt out because I'm in a perpetual cycle of going grocery shopping, trying my best to eat decently and studying. I feel like there's so much to study for university and nothing is sticking. It's already making me nervous. What should I do to feel more settled? I feel like I'm all over the place and my mind keeps wandering off. Is there anything I can do to try and keep a better schedule? Any way to motivate myself just enough to memorize some topics for classes?","834":"What to do before my semester begins.

I just wanted to know if anyone is in the same boat with me. I don\u2019t know why but it\u2019s really hard to make friend in res than in the class. When I moved to lister, everyone seemed they already have their own group. I met some people in class but they all live in off campus. I thought if I live in lister, it would be easier to make friends.. but I guess I moved too late. I\u2019m new to this school and this city. I\u2019m so lonely af in here. I\u2019m getting worried about being alone in res for rest of my first year..:( Is there anyone who\u2019s in the same boat?","836":"Anyone else struggling to adjust to in person classes?. When i say adjusting I just mean wanting to actually go to school. Learning in person is much better than online but online just seems so much better bc of the sole fact that I dont have to go anywhere. Nonetheless I am still trying to force myself to go in person but I've already taken a day off of school and it's just started for me....Just want to see if others are struggling or just me. One of my profs has done a really great thing though where the in-person and online classes are basically interchangeable, so you can just choose to do either depending on how you're feeling and it won't affect anything. I still refuse to do online classes though cause I need environmental stimulation as my brain is a pile of shit from mind-numbingly sitting on the laptop all day for the last year","837":"Stand on the right of the escalators and walk on the left..

Everything seems to be moving super fast and thinking about presenting makes me feel nauseous.","854":"Mental health support on campus?. Hey guys.\n\nThis is my first year and I feel really overwhelmed and homesick. My family is in another country and the only source of support I have is my partner who lives on the opposite end of Canada. I just feel really alone and I feel like I'm drowning in my work load. Everytime I catch up on an assignment, I fall behind again and again and now it feels like I'll never catch up ever again. \n\nTrying to take care of myself all the while trying to not fall too behind in classes is not working and im failing at both. I feel like I have to binge eat to actually feel something but like 80% of the time, im literally starving to the point Im not sure if other people can actually hear my stomach growling lmao. In all honesty I try not to ever starve myself.\n\n I also don't really like going outside but I do like in person classes (besides the commute). I like to keep to myself and I get really anxious around new people so making new friends is super hard. I also like staying home cause im a hermit but the silence in my room is almost killing me.\n\nI know this is very ranty but I was just wondering if there's some sort of a support system in campus I could reach out to. I know if I keep all this problem bottled up, it never ends up good so I want to deal with whatever is happening to me as soon as possible to function better on a daily basis.","855":"Sometimes I'm so lonely I feel like I could die.

I'm trying to get into something like ff14 and meet some of ya weirdos!","857":"Do I just talk to random people?. I\u2019m a first year and I want to meet people and make some new friends. It feels like the thing that\u2019s stopping me from doings so is that I feel out of place just walking up to random people around campus and trying to start a conversation. I don\u2019t know from looking at them what year they\u2019re in, how old they are, if they\u2019re interested in talking and so it feels out of place to initiate that with people. It feels like there\u2019s no time before class to chat with people in my classes and same thing for afterwards. Help.","858":"Shoutout to the introverts who are a little lonely. Yes, I know it helps to talk to classmates and join clubs, and I do. And it\u2019s fun of course but man is it ever nice to find those people who will show a genuine interest in you. Here\u2019s to the kids who love deep talks and asking questions but settle for the other types of friendships because they\u2019re not half bad either. I miss that kind of connection with you guys  \n\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe student who everyone thinks is an extrovert","859":"Idk what to do about this. So basically the RA knocked on my door today and gave me a CR because I'm making too much noise apparently. This one time I agree, I had 2 friends over and I myself was asking them to keep it down.  But there's someone who lives beside me who keeps saying I'm very loud and make a lot of noise at night and that I have like a bunch of dudes at my place every day etc. None of which is true, one time I was studying and heard the noises he was talking about which were coming from the floor above. I do not have people over often and when I tried explaining this to the RA he didn't seem interested in listening so I just kept quiet and complied with everything.  I'm gonna try my level best not to make any noise but is there anything else I can do?","860":"Need a cry buddy. Ngl it\u2019s been rough and I\u2019m depressed. How can I be around so many people and still feel lonely. First month of my first year at uni and I\u2019m just not feeling it. I\u2019ve talked to a bunch of people but can\u2019t seem to connect with any of them. I literally have 2 friends.","861":"I feel like an idiot because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019m currently in my first year of university and I feel like a big fat failure. I just got my first two midterm grades back and I barely passed, even though I studied for hours\/days beforehand.

I'm trying to get some help but reaching out is really hard and at the end of the day, I just feel really lost and empty.\n\n I have a feeling my gpa id going to be really low this semester since I don't see this getting any better so I just wanted to know if your GPA matters a lot when you first start to work.","866":"How do you guys keep yourselves from being burnt out?. How do you guys go about keeping yourself from feeling burnt out? Do you give yourselves days off or do you study long hours and take long breaks?\n\nIm personally feeling a little burnt out and I was planning on taking Monday off but I have so many assignments that I don't think it will happen :(","867":"The loneliness is getting to me. Almost 2 months here, no friends spend all day alone, time on campus is alone, hard to make genuine friends cause #1 I'm not that great at socializing\n#2 I get the vibe that most people wanna be friends for personal benefit. This sucks, ;-;","868":"Annoying people. Listen I don\u2019t mind people talking, even talking somewhat loud. But why do people think it\u2019s so funny to be yelling and scream laughing in public areas.

My long distance girlfriend and I broke up this week, and I\u2019ve been pretty heartbroken about it and it\u2019s really taken a toll on me. I still love her, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about her, and find myself lacking in homework or in lectures because she\u2019s all I think about. I know this isn\u2019t good or healthy, I\u2019m just really upset about this. Does anybody have any tips of how I can overcome this? I just find myself so lonely now as I don\u2019t have that person I would talk to every day in my life.","870":"Are we all collectively dying this semester?. I swear this semester has felt like being dragged down the stairs. I'm in my second year (first year on campus) so idk if this is just how uni normally is.

Do you ever feel like you\u2019re working so hard, and ask yourself, for what?\nI find myself in the same emotional states no matter what. \nSchool is just not satisfying. \nThinking of attaining a successful career isn\u2019t either. \nThinking about accumulating a lot of money doesn\u2019t do it. \nAnyone ever feel like there\u2019s just nothing to look forward to? Like what\u2019s the point of all of this.

I have 2 F\u2019s and 2 NC\u2019s but no W\u2019s. I already made the decision to withdraw from a class but I can\u2019t bring myself to actually do it for some reason. It just feels\u2026 wrong? Lol it\u2019s kind of stupid considering I\u2019ve failed 4 classes and this can\u2019t be worse than that but it still seems like a big deal to me. I\u2019m just curious though how many W\u2019s and F\u2019s other people have and how you got them?","877":"Why is this Subreddit so goddamn depressing?. I get that uni life isn\u2019t easy at all, but can anyone explain to me why the uAlberta subreddit is so bleak and gives a sense of hopelessness (for the most part). I stopped looking at it for this past week, and it\u2019s been one of the most refreshing weeks in my life. Thoughts?","878":"Pre Gym Anxiety. I have been wanting to go to the gym on campus but I have a lot of anxiety about actually going. Does anyone have any tips or anything to make it seem a little easier? I know a lot of it is in my head but any little bit helps!","879":"Anyone else feeling extremely burnt out this week.. I have a smaller load this week than I have for the past month but I'm having a hard time doing anything. Even getting out of bed in the morning to get to the bus on time feels like a huge task. Trying to sit down and work, i can only focus in maybe 30-60 minute intervals, and even if I can focus, trying to think through the problems long enough to solve them feels ridiculously hard. Definitely counting down the hours until reading week (not that I won't have work then too lol). Anyways I'm just using reddit as an opportunity to get it off my chest anonymously. Feel free to do the same.","880":"i swear to god each class wants an 8 hour work day out of you. ","881":"Ideas for getting to know someone more. It\u2019s kind of a dumb question but for some reason I just can\u2019t come up with any good ideas rn. There\u2019s a girl whom I\u2019d like to get to know more. I can\u2019t ask her on a date due to a reason I can\u2019t say. We\u2019re not in the same discipline so can\u2019t study together. I was thinking of going to a board game cafe but we\u2019d have to wear masks.\n\nAny ideas people?","882":"I hate that I'm a boring person :\/. I'm new in Edmonton, made a few friends I guess but they only call me when they're working together on a project or something, idk what's wrong with me that I never get invited to their meetups or wherever they go, it honestly sucks, I consider myself kind of a simple person and that's boring to a lot of people,maybe thats why, maybe I'm just forgettable. It's less about the lonlinees and more about the fact that my personality is so dry at finding new people that nobody even bothers to call me to hangout even though they all meet up in groups. Wish I wasn't so boring.","883":"How are we half way through reading week already?????. It's not like I haven't done anything....but it just feels surreal knowing there's only 4 days left?","884":"Reading week is a scam. \"Enjoy the time off! -Also, you have X many assignments due during the break!\"","885":"Reading week problems.

Long story short\n\nWas in a very serious situation with someone, however things got so fuckin toxic between us (a whole book to explain).\n\nI decided to cut her off, cause I could not be the person in her life she wanted me to be, nor could she be mine.\n\nHowever, despite not having any classes together, I unfortunately see her every once in a while. And shit, ngl that hurts like crazy.\n\nThe sad thing is we unforunately have a few of the same friends, so its almost impossible not to think about her. Also, we're in the same faculty, so we'll prolly have run-ins like this for the next few years.\n\nLike honestly man, we have so much fuckin bad blood between us, it is so so toxic. We never will be close again, nor even friends. I honestly dont trust her not to brew any more drama.\n\nHowever, I cant lie and say i'll stop missing her or wishing things didnt go the same way they did. I know that despite her not giving a shit about me, I still care so so much about her. Its so fuckin sad, cause Im holding onto something that doesnt exist.\n\nSo, my question to those here is how tf did you move on from someone who was truly special to you at once? especially when you still have to see them?","887":"How did everyone\u2019s reading week go?. Anyone have anything special they did? Did you complete all the things you wanted to? Feel free to share if you\u2019re comfortable!","888":"Been Weirdly Stressed Lately.... Ik this is a weird to post right after reading week, but honestly this break just made me feel guilty for not having my shit together, even though I studied every single day. I know my exam dates and times down to a tea, and I literally have every assignment and quiz due date in my brain. Knowing them just makes me feel strapped for time all the time even though we still have a month before finals. \n\nWhen I lay in bed, close my eyes, and wait to sleep, I think about how unproductive the day has been because I didn't get all of the shit I wanted to get done done. I then try to plan the next few days in my head and overwhelm myself, which continues until I doze off.\n\nBut, I wanted to ask: can anyone relate? What do you do to get out of it? I feel so anxious and stressed everyday and feel horrible for taking breaks. Just wanna relax and study for the fun of it, but it's hard when I remember how much it matters since I did kinda bad in my previous years.","889":"Post Reading Week Blues. l this week off did not feel like a week off. i know this week was suppose to help us relax but im feeling extremely anxious right now. i have a midterm and a big assignment (30% of my grade) due this week and i studied just about everyday but i don\u2019t feel prepared for either of them. maybe it\u2019s guilt from spending time doing things i enjoy?? i really missed hanging out with my family and friends back home and this week i felt guilty when i would choose to study over hanging out with them, but i would also feel guilty for spending time with them instead of studying. i haven\u2019t felt this anxious all semester (i\u2019ve actually been kinda proud of myself for staying on top of all my school work) so i\u2019m not sure what my brain is doing right now. kinda ironic since reading week was an opportunity to avoid this feeling lol. \n\ni have to start my day in less than 3 hours and i haven\u2019t gone to sleep yet so i think i can say that this is not a good first day back for me \ud83e\udd72","890":"Which one is better: D or W.

What helps you guys?","892":"Mental state.... I really hate online school. I want to go back to in person but my family moved back home, so I'm currently with them, so moving to Edmonton would cost me a lot. Online school is really taking a toll on me. I really don't know what to do. Plus, we're approaching the end of the semester. Do you think I'd pass if I try to catch up?","893":"How to deal with burn out?. This semester has not gone how I wanted at all. I feel like all I do is wake up, do homework, go to sleep every single day and every time I take some sort of a break I get punished for it by some assignment that is due. I am completely burnt out at this point, I just want to pass my courses, but yet I\u2019m skipping classes. It\u2019s like I couldn\u2019t care less anymore if I get a good mark anymore. It\u2019s like a state of apathy has overtaken me and I couldn\u2019t care less about what happens but yet I do. I have not slacked off, rather I overworked myself to exhaustion due to making the stupid decision of taking an insane course load, and even after I dropped a course I am still paying the consequences now. It feels like a never ending game of catching up, but hey, guess what, you got another 8 assignments due Monday and taking a break and relaxing won\u2019t get them done in time. Trust me I have tried.  Doing them while burnt out won\u2019t get them done in time. But one still has to somehow get them done and deal with the inevitable frustration of not being able to hand everything in. The frustration of feeling like you are slacking even though you are not. The guilt of failure and inevitable judgment that comes with it. To have to give out answer and be scolded for not trying hard enough. I have to work on top of all of this. It feels like a never ending hamster wheel that punishes me for not running, but punishes me for doing so at the same time. I can\u2019t wait until this semester is over. How do I deal with this?","894":"How long do you spend studying?. I feel like I input all my spare time into studying just to get mediocre grades and I just wanna see if how I feel has any basis.\n\nI spend around 8 hours a day in cameron library studying, 4 days a week with 4 courses.

I srsly thought after a rough two semesters last year I'd figured out how to study and manage my time but my god damn ochem class ate up 90% of my time and I'm still SO behind on it. I also took four courses to make things easier on myself but I guess my courses were just way too heavy. I just feel so burnt out. I actually kept up with my lectures and didn't get too behind on watching them but I constantly had so many assignments and labs that I feel like I hardly had time to study the material regularly and now I have no choice but to cram it all in. And often the assignments hardly related to the course content so its not like doing them helped in that respect. I would try to study here and there but there just wasn't any time. I'm not even trying to be a premed or an A student, just passing these finals is gonna take an insane amount of work. I've planned things out but I find I'm just getting stressed out if the plan is too much, but if I don't I never know what I'm supposed to be doing and get even more stressed out. I honestly did my best this semester cause I was in this same situation last year where I felt fucked for finals and wanted to avoid it but I feel exactly the same lol. I know my situation could be worse but I just feel like shit and feel isolated cause I haven't seen my friends in so long and wanted to rant to get it off my chest and see who else is feeling this way too.

Right now over half of my degree have been online and honestly I loved it since dealing with so many people all day is so tiresome. But honestly I dont even feel safe going to the grocery store, let alone sitting in a room with a bunch of people for who knows how long. Like even if it was in person, I honestly don\u2019t think I would feel safe enough to even attend (especially since Id have to fly out to Alberta)\u2026 idk y\u2019all they fucked us over with leading us on thinking it\u2019s be in person when we all know it\u2019s gonna keep being online.

I\u2019m new to this environment and I moved in to my residence couple weeks ago. As a transfer student, I am amongst 3rd years who already have their circle I guess and aren\u2019t really looking for new friends. I am quite open and I have nice conversations with people but no matter how good it goes, I don\u2019t seem to get close to anyone like a friend. I spend my time in library or walking around alone when I am not in room and it starts to suck really. With everything in campus closed because of COVID, it\u2019s even worse. The stress is the same with studies but with no outlet and no fun, it gets bad. It is starting to affect my motivation though and I don\u2019t feel like working mostly. I am not depressed or anything but it doesn\u2019t have to get pathological to be addressed.\n\nIs there a place on campus where I can go and talk maybe?

Why does it feel impossible to succeed. I\u2019ve been burnt out before, but I have no motivation left, it\u2019s never been this bad. The work I put into school, the result is never the same anymore. So I just feel like curling up in a ball and not trying. \nI wish things would go back to as normal as possible these days. \n\nNote: I\u2019m all good, just ranting and exhausted.","929":"Any advice about school and work?. So, throughout my degree so far I have been exceptionally lucky; my parents and I have an agreement that I don\u2019t have to pay rent as long as I\u2019m going to school so I\u2019ve been able to just focus on school work for the past two years. However, my parents have been pushing me really hard to get a job lately and I just don\u2019t know what to do. I am barely managing to keep on top of the four classes that I\u2019m taking, I can\u2019t imagine doing this plus a job, the anxiety make me feel nauseous. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just so anxious about it because I\u2019m spoiled, but I have managed to do work and school before. In high school I worked 20-30 hours a week on top of classes and I  had very little issue, and I\u2019ve saved up about 15 grand from that work, and I just don\u2019t know what to do.\nI\u2019m terribly worry for the ramble, I guess what I\u2019m asking is if anyone else has this problem, and how they got around it? Or maybe if anyone knows of some low-stress jobs that won\u2019t trigger my anxiety so bad?","930":"Getting to THAT time of the semester where burnout hits a new high. How do YOU deal with it?.

","932":"Don\u2019t you just wish you could switch universities?. I have zero desire to have to attend extra years at another university just to graduate somewhere else but the past month has really wrecked my love of school and I feel so disheartened. It makes me wish I could run away to another school. It\u2019s my second year and after online in the end of high school and first year, I was so excited just to see people last semester. But the novelty has run out after talks of strikes and seeing profs lack enthusiasm. I love school and I don\u2019t wanna lose my drive to learn. This is more of a ramble but it\u2019s lonely having a school that doesn\u2019t seem to care about how you do in any regard.","933":"CR\/NCR for this semester.

As we move through the semester, it is natural for us to become disgruntled with our current situation. I am very unhappy with our outlook for the next few weeks, and even potentially the next few years. However, many posts and replies found on this subreddit are negative to the extreme, and can affect our mental health if we take these opinions too seriously.

I'm not from Edmonton so I've been stressing about where to stay after Reading Week. With all the talk about the strike happening (it seems like it will be happening a week or two after March), will we be in-person for 2 weeks before everything shuts down for another 2? I would honestly just prefer to finish the rest of the semester online so that I don't have to stress about finding where to live for 2 OR 3 months (I don't know how long since I'm not sure how long a strike would be or if it's even happening). I emailed some of my profs, and half of them said they'll record lectures and half said it's not a possible option. I'm just confused on what to do ig. idk, i've been super stressed about the classes, finding a place to live, and not knowing what's going to happen in the next few weeks :(","938":"Online Learning is so detrimental to my mental health and grades.

I had a few midterms before reading week and they didn't go very well but I just don't seem to care at this point :( I used to take so much interest and put in so much hardwork into the assignments and exams before. But now I am just so done with it and this has been happening since the start of this semester . I thought maybe it is just a phase and it will be better after the break but it's still the same. I am not interested in anything. I don't want to do anything. \n\nI don't feel close to anyone, not my family or friends. They are all very nice but I don't want to trouble them with my baggage like I have done before. I just want to go somewhere alone and not think about studies for once.

The conversations with people you meet tend to always be meaningless small talk that doesn't lead to anywhere.

Ever since I got a 100 in two courses back in grade 11, I have been so fixated on getting perfect marks this year too but I feel like it's tiring me out and that ultimately, I am just wasting my time. I have other things I want to spend time on too, things like music and art. I'll have to start working once I'm in uni too and god I don't even know how to drive yet.

I was able to push through a lot of what I was feeling to get assignments done and whatnot but I\u2019m just at the point where I cannot focus on anything or do anything anymore. I am so stressed and worried about my exams my hands are literally shaking and I\u2019m barely eating because I literally want to throw up when I think about them. I am trying to study but I get so stressed and I feel like I\u2019m retaining nothing and just end up crying. I get so scared when I think about my exam my heart literally starts racing and I start getting cold sweats. I have an exam tomorrow and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so scared of failing I can\u2019t even think straight.","979":"No close friends. Is anyone else lonely? Like I have friends, but nowhere near as close with them as I was with high school friends. Guess it's just a proximity thing, the more you hangout, the closer you are, but covid has fucked that up. I didn't go to classes, so talked to no one from there. I lived on campus, but still made no close friends here. Don't get me wrong, I did meet people, but I guess they would call me a surface level friend. Like an acquaintance or something, a person they would say \"hi\" to, but nothing beyond that. Everyone has their own groups here, and the more I see people hanging out, and people in relationships, the more I feel I missed out. Never got invited to any parties or anything either. Shit. Before you say join clubs and shit, I tried that, and made some friends, but I barely even talk to them outside of the activity. I don't know how to move a relationship beyond the initial stages, like yeah I got to know this person now, but what then? Sometimes I don't even know what to talk about, so when I am hanging out with a group, I just stand there unless someone actively tries to involve me.","980":"For the science students. Do you work part-time?  If you do, can you manage time between your studies and a part-time job? How hard is it to handle both and how many hours do you work in a week?","981":"If Week of Welcome was like this, I'd probably go more.. ","982":"Finally finish this tough year with a 4.0 (relieved).

Is anyone already starting working as a new grad? How are you fit yourself into the team? I am so scared and not ready to start of mine.

I feel like I\u2019ll be able to do a lot better academically at my age, but I feel it\u2019s going to be more difficult to make friends. \n\nA lot of first years make friends &amp; have amazing experiences living on campus but I think I might feel a bit out of place, especially since I don\u2019t party much anymore &amp; am a bit shy.\n\nI was thinking of living off campus but I don\u2019t want to miss out on experiences! \n\nHow do u make friends as a first year in your mid 20\u2019s?","992":"A Little Motivation. Hi! I wanted to create this post for anyone who needs it. \n\nThis year has been rough. I just got diagnosed with adhd and started meds so my life is starting to get better, but my grades suffered this year from it. Things turned around, but during this year I had very, very low times. \n\nI just wanted to remind everyone to never, ever give up. When you're feeling down, it affects your entire day, week, month, etc. Sometimes it is so bad it feels like it's going to continue forever and that there's no way that things could change. You have to let go and let life take its course, life will always have unexpected turns and twists that you could've never imagined. \n\nIf no one told you recently, I'd like to say that I love you. You deserve to be here and be happy. Everyone deserves this (unless you're someone who harms others lol). \n\nSpeaking like this is easy when you're doing alright, but again never ever forget this no matter where in life you are. I need to be reminded of this occasionally too. When you're not working towards yourself, your happiness, when you don't realize your worth and\/or respect yourself, no grade or job or opportunity is valuable. You come to this life, in this manner, once. Congratulate yourself for every seemingly small victory and try not to beat yourself up about failure.\n\n I don't even know if I'll be able to continue in engineering, but I'm calm because I know it'll work out in the end. There's always an alternative path, timeline, etc. \n\nHope that helped, now that I think about it I kind of wrote this for myself, but I hope it helps anyone out.","993":"Looking for a gym buddy?. Hello! Was anyone interested in going to the gym with me?  I've never been to one before and I would feel a lot more comfortable if I was going with someone. I've done body weight exercises by myself a few years back so I'm not totally new to working out and an accountability partner would be nice! I was thinking of going 5x a week but if people were looking at less days I don't mind only going together sometimes :)","994":"Where did you make most of your friends in uni?. Curious."}}
